.B \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the compartment into which the Stack should be moved.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-stack\-id [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the stack.
.SS Optional Parameters
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-if\-match [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the \fIPUT\fP or \fIDELETE\fP call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous \fIGET\fP or \fIPOST\fP response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state defined by \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP\&. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
