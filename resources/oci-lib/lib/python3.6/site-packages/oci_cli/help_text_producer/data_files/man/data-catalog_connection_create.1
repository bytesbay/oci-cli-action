.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new connection.
.SH USAGE

.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.ft C
oci data\-catalog connection create [OPTIONS]
.ft P

.UNINDENT

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-catalog\-id [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Unique catalog identifier.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-data\-asset\-key [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Unique data asset key.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-display\-name [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A user\-friendly display name. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-properties [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A map of maps that contains the properties which are specific to the connection type. Each connection type definition defines it\(aqs set of required and optional properties. The map keys are category names and the values are maps of property name to property value. Every property is contained inside of a category. Most connections have required properties within the "default" category. To determine the set of optional and required properties for a connection type, a query can be done on \(aq/types?type=connection\(aq that returns a collection of all connection types. The appropriate connection type, which will include definitions of all of it\(aqs properties, can be identified from this collection. Example: \fI{"properties": { "default": { "username": "user1"}}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-type\-key [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The key of the object type. Type key\(aqs can be found via the \(aq/types\(aq endpoint.
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-description [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A description of the connection.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-enc\-properties [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A map of maps that contains the encrypted values for sensitive properties which are specific to the connection type. Each connection type definition defines it\(aqs set of required and optional properties. The map keys are category names and the values are maps of property name to property value. Every property is contained inside of a category. Most connections have required properties within the "default" category. To determine the set of optional and required properties for a connection type, a query can be done on \(aq/types?type=connection\(aq that returns a collection of all connection types. The appropriate connection type, which will include definitions of all of it\(aqs properties, can be identified from this collection. Example: \fI{"encProperties": { "default": { "password": "pwd"}}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-is\-default [boolean]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Indicates whether this connection is the default connection. The first connection of a data asset defaults to being the default, subsequent connections default to not being the default. If a default connection already exists, then trying to create a connection as the default will fail. In this case the default connection would need to be updated not to be the default and then the new connection can then be created as the default.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP\&. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.sp
Accepted values are:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.B \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Check every \fB\-\-wait\-interval\-seconds\fP to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP\&. Defaults to 30 seconds.
