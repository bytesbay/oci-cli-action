Required Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The ID of the compartment in which to create the bucket.

letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, and periods. Bucket names must
be unique within an Object Storage namespace. Avoid entering

Optional Parameters
===================

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags. Example:
*{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}* This is a complex type whose
value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the
command line or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file
syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags. Example: *{"Department": "Finance"}* This is a complex
type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
string on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--kms-key-id [text]

The OCID of a master encryption key used to call the Key Management
service to generate a data encryption key or to encrypt or decrypt a
data encryption key.

--metadata [complex type]

Arbitrary string, up to 4KB, of keys and values for user-defined
metadata. This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The
value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as
a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--namespace-name, --namespace, -ns [text]

The Object Storage namespace used for the request. If not provided,
this parameter will be obtained internally using a call to 'oci os ns
get'

--object-events-enabled [boolean]

Whether or not events are emitted for object state changes in this
bucket. By default, *objectEventsEnabled* is set to *false*. Set
*objectEventsEnabled* to *true* to emit events for object state
changes. For more information about events, see Overview of Events.

--public-access-type [text]

The type of public access enabled on this bucket. A bucket is set to
*NoPublicAccess* by default, which only allows an authenticated caller
to access the bucket and its contents. When *ObjectRead* is enabled on
the bucket, public access is allowed for the *GetObject*,
*HeadObject*, and *ListObjects* operations. When
*ObjectReadWithoutList* is enabled on the bucket, public access is
allowed for the *GetObject* and *HeadObject* operations.

Accepted values are:

   NoPublicAccess, ObjectRead, ObjectReadWithoutList

--storage-tier [text]

The type of storage tier of this bucket. A bucket is set to 'Standard'
tier by default, which means the bucket will be put in the standard
storage tier. When 'Archive' tier type is set explicitly, the bucket
is put in the Archive Storage tier. The 'storageTier' property is
immutable after bucket is created.

Accepted values are:

   Archive, Standard

--versioning [text]

Set the versioning status on the bucket. By default, a bucket is
created with versioning *Disabled*. Use this option to enable
versioning during bucket creation. Objects in a version enabled bucket
are protected from overwrites and deletions. Previous versions of the
same object will be available in the bucket.

Accepted values are:

   Disabled, Enabled
