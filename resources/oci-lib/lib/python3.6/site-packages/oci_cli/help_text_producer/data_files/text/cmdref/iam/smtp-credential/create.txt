"create"
********


Description
===========

Creates a new SMTP credential for the specified user. An SMTP
credential has an SMTP user name and an SMTP password. You must
specify a *description* for the SMTP credential (although it can be an
empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it
anytime with UpdateSmtpCredential.


Usage
=====

   oci iam smtp-credential create [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--description [text]

The description you assign to the SMTP credentials during creation.
Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable.

--user-id [text]

The OCID of the user.


Optional Parameters
===================

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
