.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-node\-pool\-id [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCID of the node pool.
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-force
.UNINDENT
.sp
Perform update without prompting for confirmation.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-if\-match [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-initial\-node\-labels [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A list of key/value pairs to add to nodes after they join the Kubernetes cluster.

This option is a JSON list with items of type KeyValue.  For documentation on KeyValue please see our API reference: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/containerengine/20180222/datatypes/KeyValue\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example

Specify the configuration of the shape to launch nodes in the node pool.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example

.UNINDENT
.sp
The number of nodes to have in each subnet specified in the subnetIds property. This property is deprecated, use nodeConfigDetails instead. If the current value of quantityPerSubnet is greater than 0, you can only use quantityPerSubnet to scale the node pool. If the current value of quantityPerSubnet is equal to 0 and the current value of size in nodeConfigDetails is greater than 0, before you can use quantityPerSubnet, you must first scale the node pool to 0 nodes using nodeConfigDetails.

.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
