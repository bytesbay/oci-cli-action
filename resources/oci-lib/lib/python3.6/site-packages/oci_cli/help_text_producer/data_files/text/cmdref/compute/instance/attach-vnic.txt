"attach-vnic"
*************


Description
===========

Creates a secondary VNIC and attaches it to the specified instance.
You can specify either --subnet-id or --vlan-id for this create
request, but not both. For more information about secondary VNICs, see
Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs).


Usage
=====

   oci compute instance attach-vnic [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--instance-id [text]

The OCID of the instance.


Optional Parameters
===================

--assign-public-ip [boolean]

Whether the VNIC should be assigned a public IP address. Defaults to
whether the subnet is public or private. If not set and the VNIC is
being created in a private subnet (i.e., where
prohibitPublicIpOnVnic=true in the Subnet), then no public IP address
is assigned. If not set and the subnet is public
(prohibitPublicIpOnVnic=false), then a public IP address is assigned.
If set to true and prohibitPublicIpOnVnic=true, an error is returned.

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags. Example:
*{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}* This is a complex type whose
value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the
command line or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file
syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags. Example: *{"Department": "Finance"}* This is a complex
type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
string on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--hostname-label [text]

The hostname for the VNIC. Used for DNS. The value is the hostname
portion of the VNIC's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (e.g.,
*bminstance-1* in FQDN *bminstance-1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com*).
Must be unique across all VNICs in the subnet and comply with RFC 952
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc952) and RFC 1123
(https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123). The value can be retrieved from
the Vnic (#/en/iaas/20160918/Vnic/).

--nic-index [integer]

Which physical network interface card (NIC) the VNIC will use.
Defaults to 0. Certain bare metal instance shapes have two active
physical NICs (0 and 1). If you add a secondary VNIC to one of these
instances, you can specify which NIC the VNIC will use.

--nsg-ids [complex type]

A list of the [OCIDs] of the network security groups (NSGs) to add the
VNIC to.. This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The
value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as
a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--private-ip [text]

A private IP address of your choice to assign to the VNIC. Must be an
available IP address within the subnet's CIDR. If no value is
specified, a private IP address from the subnet will be automatically
assigned.

--skip-source-dest-check [boolean]

Indicates whether Source/Destination check is disabled on the VNIC.
Defaults to *false*, in which case we enable Source/Destination check
on the VNIC.

--subnet-id [text]

The OCID of the subnet to create the VNIC in. You can specify either
this parameter or --vlan-id, but not both.

--vlan-id [text]

The OCID of the VLAN to create the VNIC in. You can specify either
this parameter or --subnet-id, but not both.

--vnic-display-name [text]

A user-friendly name for the VNIC. Does not have to be unique.

--wait

If set, then wait for the attachment to complete and return the newly
attached VNIC. If not set, then the command will not wait and will
return nothing on success.
