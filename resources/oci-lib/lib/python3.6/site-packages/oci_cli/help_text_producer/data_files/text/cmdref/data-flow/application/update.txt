"update"
********


Description
===========

Updates an application using an *applicationId*.


Usage
=====

   oci data-flow application update [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--application-id [text]

The unique ID for an application.


Optional Parameters
===================

--archive-uri [text]

An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure URI of an archive.zip file containing
custom dependencies that may be used to support the execution a
Python, Java, or Scala application. See https://docs.cloud.oracle.com
/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/hdfsconnector.htm#uriformat.

--arguments [text]

The arguments passed to the running application as command line
arguments. Arguments may contain zero or more placeholders that are
replaced using values from the parameters map. Each placeholder
specified must be represented in the parameters map else the request
will fail with a HTTP 400 status code. Placeholders are specified as
*${name}*, where *name* is the name of the parameter. Example:  '--
input ${input_file} --name "John Doe"'  Alternatively, the arguments
can be specified as a JSON array of strings where each string
represent an argument. Example:  [ "--input", "${input_file}", "--
name", "John Doe" ]  If "input_file" has a value of "mydata.xml", then
the value above will be translated to *--input mydata.xml --name "John
Doe"*

--class-name [text]

The class for the application.

--configuration [text]

The Spark configuration passed to the running process. See
https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html#available-
properties Example: 'spark.app.name="My App Name"
spark.shuffle.io.maxRetries=4'  Alternatively, the configuration can
be specified as a JSON objects. Example:  { "spark.app.name" : "My App
Name", "spark.shuffle.io.maxRetries" : "4" }  Note: Not all Spark
properties are permitted to be set. Attempting to set a property that
is not allowed to be overwritten will cause a 400 status to be
returned.

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags. Example:
*{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}* This is a complex type whose
value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the
command line or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file
syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--description [text]

A user-friendly description. Avoid entering confidential information.

--display-name [text]

A user-friendly name. It does not have to be unique. Avoid entering
confidential information.

--driver-shape [text]

The VM shape for the driver. Sets the driver cores and memory.

--executor-shape [text]

The VM shape for the executors. Sets the executor cores and memory.

--file-uri [text]

An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure URI of the file containing the
application to execute. See https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conten
t/API/SDKDocs/hdfsconnector.htm#uriformat.

--force

Perform update without prompting for confirmation.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags. Example: *{"Department": "Finance"}* This is a complex
type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
string on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--from-json [text]

--if-match [text]

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource. The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource's
current etag value.

--language [text]

The Spark language.

Accepted values are:

   JAVA, PYTHON, SCALA, SQL

--logs-bucket-uri [text]

An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure URI of the bucket where the Spark job
logs are to be uploaded. See https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/hdfsconnector.htm#uriformat.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--num-executors [integer]

The number of executor VMs requested.

--parameters [text]

A string of name=value pairs used to supply SQL parameters or fill
placeholders found in the arguments parameter. The name must be a
string of one or more word characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _). The value
can be a string of zero or more characters of any kind. Example:
'iterations=10 input_file=mydata.xml variable_x=${x}'  Alternatively,
the arguments can be specified as a JSON array of objects. Example:  [
{ name : "iterations", value : "10" }, { name : "input_file", value :
"mydata.xml" }, { name : "variable_x", value : "${x}" } ]

--private-endpoint-id [text]

The OCID of a private endpoint.

--spark-version [text]

The Spark version utilized to run the application.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACTIVE, DELETED, INACTIVE

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource to

state". Defaults to 30 seconds.

--warehouse-bucket-uri [text]

An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure URI of the bucket to be used as default
warehouse directory for BATCH SQL runs. See https://docs.cloud.oracle
