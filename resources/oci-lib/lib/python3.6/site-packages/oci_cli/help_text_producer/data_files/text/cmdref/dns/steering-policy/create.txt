"create"
********


Description
===========

Creates a new steering policy in the specified compartment. For more
information on creating policies with templates, see Traffic
Management API Guide.


Usage
=====

   oci dns steering-policy create [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the compartment containing the steering policy.

--display-name [text]

A user-friendly name for the steering policy. Does not have to be
unique and can be changed. Avoid entering confidential information.

--template [text]

A set of predefined rules based on the desired purpose of the steering
policy. Each template utilizes Traffic Management's rules in a
different order to produce the desired results when answering DNS
queries.

   **Example:** The *FAILOVER* template determines answers by
   filtering the policy's answers using the *FILTER* rule first, then
   the following rules in succession: *HEALTH*, *PRIORITY*, and
   *LIMIT*. This gives the domain dynamic failover capability.

   It is **strongly recommended** to use a template other than
   *CUSTOM* when creating a steering policy.

   All templates require the rule order to begin with an unconditional
   *FILTER* rule that keeps answers contingent upon *answer.isDisabled
   != true*, except for *CUSTOM*. A defined *HEALTH* rule must follow
   the *FILTER* rule if the policy references a
   *healthCheckMonitorId*. The last rule of a template must must be a
   *LIMIT* rule. For more information about templates and code
   examples, see Traffic Management API Guide.

**Template Types**

* *FAILOVER* - Uses health check information on your endpoints to
  determine which DNS answers to serve. If an endpoint fails a health
  check, the answer for that endpoint will be removed from the list of
  available answers until the endpoint is detected as healthy.

   * *LOAD_BALANCE* - Distributes web traffic to specified endpoints
     based on defined weights.

   * *ROUTE_BY_GEO* - Answers DNS queries based on the query's
     geographic location. For a list of geographic locations to route
     by, see Traffic Management Geographic Locations.

   * *ROUTE_BY_ASN* - Answers DNS queries based on the query's
     originating ASN.

   * *ROUTE_BY_IP* - Answers DNS queries based on the query's IP
     address.

   * *CUSTOM* - Allows a customized configuration of rules.

Accepted values are:

   CUSTOM, FAILOVER, LOAD_BALANCE, ROUTE_BY_ASN, ROUTE_BY_GEO, ROUTE_BY_IP


Optional Parameters
===================

--answers [complex type]

The set of all answers that can potentially issue from the steering
policy.

This option is a JSON list with items of type SteeringPolicyAnswer.
For documentation on SteeringPolicyAnswer please see our API
reference: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/dns/20180115/dataty
pes/SteeringPolicyAnswer. This is a complex type whose value must be
valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line
or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags.

   **Example:** *{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}*

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags.

   **Example:** *{"Department": "Finance"}*

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--health-check-monitor-id [text]

The OCID of the health check monitor providing health data about the
answers of the steering policy. A steering policy answer with *rdata*
matching a monitored endpoint will use the health data of that
endpoint. A steering policy answer with *rdata* not matching any
monitored endpoint will be assumed healthy.

**Note:** To use the Health Check monitoring feature in a steering
policy, a monitor must be created using the Health Checks service
first. For more information on how to create a monitor, please see
Managing Health Checks.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--rules [complex type]

The series of rules that will be processed in sequence to reduce the
pool of answers to a response for any given request.

   The first rule receives a shuffled list of all answers, and every
   other rule receives the list of answers emitted by the one
   preceding it. The last rule populates the response.

This option is a JSON list with items of type SteeringPolicyRule.  For
documentation on SteeringPolicyRule please see our API reference: htt
ps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/dns/20180115/datatypes/SteeringPo
licyRule. This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The
value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as
a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--ttl [integer]

The Time To Live (TTL) for responses from the steering policy, in
seconds. If not specified during creation, a value of 30 seconds will
be used.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACTIVE, CREATING, DELETED, DELETING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource to
see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by "--wait-for-
state". Defaults to 30 seconds.
