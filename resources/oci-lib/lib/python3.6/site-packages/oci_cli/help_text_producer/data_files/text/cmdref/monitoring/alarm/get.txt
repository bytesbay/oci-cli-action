"get"
*****


Description
===========

Gets the specified alarm. For important limits information, see Limits
on Monitoring.

This call is subject to a Monitoring limit that applies to the total
number of requests across all alarm operations. Monitoring might
throttle this call to reject an otherwise valid request when the total
rate of alarm operations exceeds 10 requests, or transactions, per
second (TPS) for a given tenancy.


Usage
=====

   oci monitoring alarm get [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--alarm-id [text]

The OCID of an alarm.


Optional Parameters
===================

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
