"update"
********


Description
===========

Updates the specified VNIC.


Usage
=====

   oci network vnic update [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--vnic-id [text]

The OCID of the VNIC.


Optional Parameters
===================

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--display-name [text]

A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable.
Avoid entering confidential information.

--force

Perform update without prompting for confirmation.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Department": "Finance"}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--hostname-label [text]

The hostname for the VNIC's primary private IP. Used for DNS. The
value is the hostname portion of the primary private IP's fully
qualified domain name (FQDN) (for example, *bminstance-1* in FQDN
*bminstance-1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com*). Must be unique across
all VNICs in the subnet and comply with RFC 952 and RFC 1123. The
value appears in the Vnic object and also the PrivateIp object
returned by ListPrivateIps and GetPrivateIp.

For more information, see DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network.

--if-match [text]

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource's
current etag value.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--nsg-ids [complex type]

A list of the OCIDs of the network security groups (NSGs) to add the
VNIC to. Setting this as an empty array removes the VNIC from all
network security groups.

If the VNIC belongs to a VLAN as part of the Oracle Cloud VMware
Solution (instead of belonging to a subnet), the value of the *nsgIds*
attribute is ignored. Instead, the VNIC belongs to the NSGs that are
associated with the VLAN itself. See Vlan.

For more information about NSGs, see NetworkSecurityGroup. This is a
complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided
as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--skip-source-dest-check [boolean]

Whether the source/destination check is disabled on the VNIC. Defaults
to *false*, which means the check is performed. For information about
why you would skip the source/destination check, see Using a Private
IP as a Route Target.

If the VNIC belongs to a VLAN as part of the Oracle Cloud VMware
Solution (instead of belonging to a subnet), the value of the
*skipSourceDestCheck* attribute is ignored. This is because the
source/destination check is always disabled for VNICs in a VLAN.
Example: *true*

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   AVAILABLE, PROVISIONING, TERMINATED, TERMINATING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource to
see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by "--wait-for-
state". Defaults to 30 seconds.
