The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.

Note that when provisioning an Autonomous Database on \fI\%dedicated Exadata infrastructure\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Database/Concepts/adbddoverview.htm\fP>, this attribute must be null because the attribute is already set at the Autonomous Exadata Infrastructure level. When using \fI\%shared Exadata infrastructure\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Database/Concepts/adboverview.htm#AEI\fP>, if a value is not specified, the system will supply the value of \fIBRING_YOUR_OWN_LICENSE\fP\&.

.UNINDENT
.sp
A list of the \fI\%OCIDs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the network security groups (NSGs) that this resource belongs to. Setting this to an empty array after the list is created removes the resource from all NSGs. For more information about NSGs, see \fI\%Security Rules\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/securityrules.htm\fP>\&. \fBNsgIds restrictions:\fP \- Autonomous Databases with private access require at least 1 Network Security Group (NSG). The nsgIds array cannot be empty.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.

.B \-\-subnet\-id [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the subnet the resource is associated with.
.sp
\fBSubnet Restrictions:\fP \- For bare metal DB systems and for single node virtual machine DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.16.16/28. \- For Exadata and virtual machine 2\-node RAC DB systems, do not use a subnet that overlaps with 192.168.128.0/20. \- For Autonomous Database, setting this will disable public secure access to the database.
.sp
These subnets are used by the Oracle Clusterware private interconnect on the database instance. Specifying an overlapping subnet will cause the private interconnect to malfunction. This restriction applies to both the client subnet and the backup subnet.

.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.

Only clients connecting from an IP address included in the ACL may access the Autonomous Database instance. This is an array of CIDR (Classless Inter\-Domain Routing) notations for a subnet or VCN OCID. To add the whitelist VCN specific subnet or IP, use a semicoln \(aq;\(aq as a deliminator to add the VCN specific subnets or IPs. Example: \fI["1.1.1.1","1.1.1.0/24","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.aaaaaaaard2hfx2nn3e5xeo6j6o62jga44xjizkw","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.aaaaaaaard2hfx2nn3e5xeo6j6o62jga44xjizkw;1.1.1.1","ocid1.vcn.oc1.sea.aaaaaaaard2hfx2nn3e5xeo6j6o62jga44xjizkw;1.1.0.0/16"]\fP
