cpe
***


Description
===========

An object you create when setting up an IPSec VPN between your on-
premises network and VCN. The *Cpe* is a virtual representation of
your customer-premises equipment, which is the actual router on-
premises at your site at your end of the IPSec VPN connection. For
more information, see Overview of the Networking Service.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
