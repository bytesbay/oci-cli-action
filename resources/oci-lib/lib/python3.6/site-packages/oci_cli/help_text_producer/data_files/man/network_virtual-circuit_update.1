.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Updates the specified virtual circuit. This can be called by either the customer who owns the virtual circuit, or the provider (when provisioning or de\-provisioning the virtual circuit from their end). The documentation for \fI\%UpdateVirtualCircuitDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/requests/UpdateVirtualCircuitDetails\fP> indicates who can update each property of the virtual circuit.
.sp
\fBImportant:\fP If the virtual circuit is working and in the PROVISIONED state, updating any of the network\-related properties (such as the DRG being used, the BGP ASN, and so on) will cause the virtual circuit\(aqs state to switch to PROVISIONING and the related BGP session to go down. After Oracle re\-provisions the virtual circuit, its state will return to PROVISIONED. Make sure you confirm that the associated BGP session is back up. For more information about the various states and how to test connectivity, see \fI\%FastConnect Overview\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnect.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To change the list of public IP prefixes for a public virtual circuit, use \fI\%BulkAddVirtualCircuitPublicPrefixes\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/VirtualCircuitPublicPrefix/BulkAddVirtualCircuitPublicPrefixes\fP> and \fI\%BulkDeleteVirtualCircuitPublicPrefixes\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/VirtualCircuitPublicPrefix/BulkDeleteVirtualCircuitPublicPrefixes\fP>\&. Updating the list of prefixes does NOT cause the BGP session to go down. However, Oracle must verify the customer\(aqs ownership of each added prefix before traffic for that prefix will flow across the virtual circuit.

.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
