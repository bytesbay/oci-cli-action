Optional Parameters
===================

--description [text]

Detailed description of a data entity.

--folder-key [text]

Key of the associated folder.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--harvest-status [text]

Status of the object as updated by the harvest process. When an entity
object is created , it's harvest status will indicate if the entity's
metadata has been fully harvested or not. The harvest process can
perform shallow harvesting to allow users to browse the metadata and
can on-demand deep harvest on any object This requires a harvest
status indicator for catalog objects.

Accepted values are:

   COMPLETE, DEFERRED, ERROR, IN_PROGRESS

--is-logical [boolean]

Property to indicate if the object is a physical materialized object
or virtual. For example, View.

--is-partition [boolean]

Property to indicate if the object is a sub object of a parent
physical object.

--last-job-key [text]

Key of the last harvest process to update this object.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--properties [complex type]

A map of maps that contains the properties which are specific to the
entity type. Each entity type definition defines it's set of required
and optional properties. The map keys are category names and the
values are maps of property name to property value. Every property is
contained inside of a category. Most entities have required properties
within the "default" category. To determine the set of required and
optional properties for an entity type, a query can be done on
'/types?type=dataEntity' that returns a collection of all entity
types. The appropriate entity type, which includes definitions of all
of it's properties, can be identified from this collection. Example:
*{"properties": { "default": { "key1": "value1"}}}* This is a complex
type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
string on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACTIVE, CREATING, DELETED, DELETING, FAILED, INACTIVE, MOVING, UPDATING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource to
see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by "--wait-for-
state". Defaults to 30 seconds.
