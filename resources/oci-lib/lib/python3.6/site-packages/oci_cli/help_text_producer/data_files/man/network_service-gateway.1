.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Represents a router that lets your VCN privately access specific Oracle services such as Object Storage without exposing the VCN to the public internet. Traffic leaving the VCN and destined for a supported Oracle service (see \fI\%ListServices\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Service/ListServices\fP>) is routed through the service gateway and does not traverse the internet. The instances in the VCN do not need to have public IP addresses nor be in a public subnet. The VCN does not need an internet gateway for this traffic. For more information, see \fI\%Access to Oracle Services: Service Gateway\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/servicegateway.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

.SS Description
.sp
Adds the specified \fI\%Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Service/\fP> to the list of enabled \fIService\fP objects for the specified gateway. You must also set up a route rule with the \fIcidrBlock\fP of the \fIService\fP as the rule\(aqs destination and the service gateway as the rule\(aqs target. See \fI\%Route Table\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/RouteTable/\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP The \fIAttachServiceId\fP operation is an easy way to add an individual \fIService\fP to the service gateway. Compare it with \fI\%UpdateServiceGateway\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/ServiceGateway/UpdateServiceGateway\fP>, which replaces the entire existing list of enabled \fIService\fP objects with the list that you provide in the \fIUpdate\fP call.
