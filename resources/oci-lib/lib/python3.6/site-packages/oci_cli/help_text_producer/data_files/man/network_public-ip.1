.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A \fIpublic IP\fP is a conceptual term that refers to a public IP address and related properties. The \fIpublicIp\fP object is the API representation of a public IP.
.sp
There are two types of public IPs: 1. Ephemeral 2. Reserved
.sp
For more information and comparison of the two types, see \fI\%Public IP Addresses\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingpublicIPs.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

.SS Description
.sp
Moves a public IP into a different compartment within the same tenancy. For information about moving resources between compartments, see \fI\%Moving Resources to a Different Compartment\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm#moveRes\fP>\&.
.sp
This operation applies only to reserved public IPs. Ephemeral public IPs always belong to the same compartment as their VNIC and move accordingly.

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.

.SS \fBcreate\fP
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a public IP. Use the \fIlifetime\fP property to specify whether it\(aqs an ephemeral or reserved public IP. For information about limits on how many you can create, see \fI\%Public IP Addresses\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingpublicIPs.htm\fP>\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFor an ephemeral public IP assigned to a private IP:\fP You must also specify a \fIprivateIpId\fP with the OCID of the primary private IP you want to assign the public IP to. The public IP is created in the same availability domain as the private IP. An ephemeral public IP must always be assigned to a private IP, and only to the \fIprimary\fP private IP on a VNIC, not a secondary private IP. Exception: If you create a \fI\%NatGateway\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/NatGateway/\fP>, Oracle automatically assigns the NAT gateway a regional ephemeral public IP that you cannot remove.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBFor a reserved public IP:\fP You may also optionally assign the public IP to a private IP by specifying \fIprivateIpId\fP\&. Or you can later assign the public IP with \fI\%UpdatePublicIp\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PublicIp/UpdatePublicIp\fP>\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNote:\fP When assigning a public IP to a private IP, the private IP must not already have a public IP with \fIlifecycleState\fP = ASSIGNING or ASSIGNED. If it does, an error is returned.
.sp
Also, for reserved public IPs, the optional assignment part of this operation is asynchronous. Poll the public IP\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP to determine if the assignment succeeded.

.SS \fBdelete\fP
.SS Description
.sp
Unassigns and deletes the specified public IP (either ephemeral or reserved). You must specify the object\(aqs OCID. The public IP address is returned to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure public IP pool.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP You cannot update, unassign, or delete the public IP that Oracle automatically assigned to an entity for you (such as a load balancer or NAT gateway). The public IP is automatically deleted if the assigned entity is terminated.
.sp
For an assigned reserved public IP, the initial unassignment portion of this operation is asynchronous. Poll the public IP\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP to determine if the operation succeeded.
.sp
If you want to simply unassign a reserved public IP and return it to your pool of reserved public IPs, instead use \fI\%UpdatePublicIp\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PublicIp/UpdatePublicIp\fP>\&.

.SS \fBupdate\fP
.SS Description
.sp
Updates the specified public IP. You must specify the object\(aqs OCID. Use this operation if you want to:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Assign a reserved public IP in your pool to a private IP. * Move a reserved public IP to a different private IP. * Unassign a reserved public IP from a private IP (which returns it to your pool of reserved public IPs). * Change the display name or tags for a public IP.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Assigning, moving, and unassigning a reserved public IP are asynchronous operations. Poll the public IP\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP to determine if the operation succeeded.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP When moving a reserved public IP, the target private IP must not already have a public IP with \fIlifecycleState\fP = ASSIGNING or ASSIGNED. If it does, an error is returned. Also, the initial unassignment from the original private IP always succeeds, but the assignment to the target private IP is asynchronous and could fail silently (for example, if the target private IP is deleted or has a different public IP assigned to it in the interim). If that occurs, the public IP remains unassigned and its \fIlifecycleState\fP switches to AVAILABLE (it is not reassigned to its original private IP). You must poll the public IP\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP to determine if the move succeeded.
.sp
Regarding ephemeral public IPs:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
If you want to assign an ephemeral public IP to a primary private IP, use \fI\%CreatePublicIp\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PublicIp/CreatePublicIp\fP>\&. * You can\(aqt move an ephemeral public IP to a different private IP. * If you want to unassign an ephemeral public IP from its private IP, use \fI\%DeletePublicIp\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PublicIp/DeletePublicIp\fP>, which unassigns and deletes the ephemeral public IP.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNote:\fP If a public IP is assigned to a secondary private IP (see \fI\%PrivateIp\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PrivateIp/\fP>), and you move that secondary private IP to another VNIC, the public IP moves with it.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP There\(aqs a limit to the number of \fI\%public IPs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/PublicIp/\fP> a VNIC or instance can have. If you try to move a reserved public IP to a VNIC or instance that has already reached its public IP limit, an error is returned. For information about the public IP limits, see \fI\%Public IP Addresses\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingpublicIPs.htm\fP>\&.

.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
