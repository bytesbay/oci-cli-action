Description
===========

An *IPv6* is a conceptual term that refers to an IPv6 address and
related properties. The *IPv6* object is the API representation of an

You can create and assign an IPv6 to any VNIC that is in an
IPv6-enabled subnet in an IPv6-enabled VCN.

**Note:** IPv6 addressing is currently supported only in certain
regions. For important details about IPv6 addressing in a VCN, see
