"update"
********


Description
===========

Updates the configuration of a backend server within the specified
backend set.


Usage
=====

   oci lb backend update [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--backend-name [text]

The IP address and port of the backend server to update.

Example:

   10.0.0.3:8080

--backend-set-name [text]

The name of the backend set associated with the backend server.

Example:

   example_backend_set

--backup [boolean]

Whether the load balancer should treat this server as a backup unit.
If *true*, the load balancer forwards no ingress traffic to this
backend server unless all other backend servers not marked as "backup"
fail the health check policy.

**Note:** You cannot add a backend server marked as *backup* to a
backend set that uses the IP Hash policy.

Example:

   false

--drain [boolean]

Whether the load balancer should drain this server. Servers marked
"drain" receive no new incoming traffic.

Example:

   false

--load-balancer-id [text]

The OCID of the load balancer associated with the backend set and
server.

--offline [boolean]

Whether the load balancer should treat this server as offline. Offline
servers receive no incoming traffic.

Example:

   false

--weight [integer]

The load balancing policy weight assigned to the server. Backend
servers with a higher weight receive a larger proportion of incoming
traffic. For example, a server weighted '3' receives 3 times the
number of new connections as a server weighted '1'. For more
information on load balancing policies, see How Load Balancing
Policies Work.

Example:

   3


Optional Parameters
===================

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource
and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation.
Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work
request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified,
returning on the first state. For example, "--wait-for-state"
SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on whichever
lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code
of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACCEPTED, FAILED, IN_PROGRESS, SUCCEEDED

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the work request
to see if it has reached the state defined by "--wait-for-state".
Defaults to 30 seconds.
