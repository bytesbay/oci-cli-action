.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP

Supported values for interval: \fI1m\fP\-\fI60m\fP (also \fI1h\fP). You can optionally specify dimensions and grouping functions. Supported grouping functions: \fIgrouping()\fP, \fIgroupBy()\fP\&. For details about Monitoring Query Language (MQL), see \fI\%Monitoring Query Language (MQL) Reference\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Reference/mql.htm\fP>\&.

.B \-\-metric\-compartment\-id\-in\-subtree [boolean]
.UNINDENT
.sp
When true, the alarm evaluates metrics from all compartments and subcompartments. The parameter can only be set to true when metricCompartmentId is the tenancy OCID (the tenancy is the root compartment). A true value requires the user to have tenancy\-level permissions. If this requirement is not met, then the call is rejected. When false, the alarm evaluates metrics from only the compartment specified in metricCompartmentId. Default is false.

The duration is specified as a string in ISO 8601 format (\fIPT10M\fP for ten minutes or \fIPT1H\fP for one hour). Minimum: PT1M. Maximum: PT1H. Default: PT1M.

.SS Description
.sp
Lists the alarms for the specified compartment. For important limits information, see \fI\%Limits on Monitoring\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Monitoring/Concepts/monitoringoverview.htm#Limits\fP>\&.
.sp
This call is subject to a Monitoring limit that applies to the total number of requests across all alarm operations. Monitoring might throttle this call to reject an otherwise valid request when the total rate of alarm operations exceeds 10 requests, or transactions, per second (TPS) for a given tenancy.
