********


Description
===========

Creates a new alarm in the specified compartment.


Usage
=====

   oci monitoring alarm create [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the compartment containing the alarm.

--destinations [complex type]

A list of destinations to which the notifications for this alarm will
be delivered. Each destination is represented by an OCID related to
the supported destination service. For example, a destination using
the Notifications service is represented by a topic OCID. Supported
destination services: Notifications Service. Limit: One destination
per supported destination service. This is a complex type whose value
must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the
command line or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file
syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--display-name [text]

A user-friendly name for the alarm. It does not have to be unique, and
it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.

This name is sent as the title for notifications related to this
alarm.

Example:

   High CPU Utilization

--is-enabled [boolean]

Whether the alarm is enabled.

Example:

   true

--metric-compartment-id [text]

The OCID of the compartment containing the metric being evaluated by
the alarm.

--namespace [text]

The source service or application emitting the metric that is
evaluated by the alarm.

Example:

   oci_computeagent

--query-text [text]

The Monitoring Query Language (MQL) expression to evaluate for the
alarm. The Alarms feature of the Monitoring service interprets results
for each returned time series as Boolean values, where zero represents
false and a non-zero value represents true. A true value means that
the trigger rule condition has been met. The query must specify a
metric, statistic, interval, and trigger rule (threshold or absence).
Supported values for interval: *1m*-*60m* (also *1h*). You can
optionally specify dimensions and grouping functions. Supported
grouping functions: *grouping()*, *groupBy()*. For details about
Monitoring Query Language (MQL), see Monitoring Query Language (MQL)
Reference. For available dimensions, review the metric definition for
the supported service. See Supported Services.

Example of threshold alarm:

      CpuUtilization[1m]{availabilityDomain="cumS:PHX-
      AD-1"}.groupBy(availabilityDomain).percentile(0.9) > 85

Example of absence alarm:

      CpuUtilization[1m]{availabilityDomain="cumS:PHX-AD-1"}.absent()

--severity [text]

The perceived type of response required when the alarm is in the
"FIRING" state.

Example:

   CRITICAL


Optional Parameters
===================

--body [text]

The human-readable content of the notification delivered. Oracle
recommends providing guidance to operators for resolving the alarm
condition. Consider adding links to standard runbook practices. Avoid
entering confidential information.

Example:

   High CPU usage alert. Follow runbook instructions for resolution.

--defined-tags [complex type]

Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to
namespaces. Example: *{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}* This is a
complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided
as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name,
type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example:
*{"Department": "Finance"}* This is a complex type whose value must be
valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line
or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--metric-compartment-id-in-subtree [boolean]

When true, the alarm evaluates metrics from all compartments and
subcompartments. The parameter can only be set to true when
metricCompartmentId is the tenancy OCID (the tenancy is the root
compartment). A true value requires the user to have tenancy-level
permissions. If this requirement is not met, then the call is
rejected. When false, the alarm evaluates metrics from only the
compartment specified in metricCompartmentId. Default is false.

Example:

   true

--pending-duration [text]

The period of time that the condition defined in the alarm must
persist before the alarm state changes from "OK" to "FIRING". For
example, a value of 5 minutes means that the alarm must persist in
breaching the condition for five minutes before the alarm updates its
state to "FIRING".

The duration is specified as a string in ISO 8601 format (*PT10M* for
ten minutes or *PT1H* for one hour). Minimum: PT1M. Maximum: PT1H.
Default: PT1M.

Under the default value of PT1M, the first evaluation that breaches
the alarm updates the state to "FIRING".

The alarm updates its status to "OK" when the breaching condition has
been clear for the most recent minute.

Example:

   PT5M

--repeat-notification-duration [text]

The frequency at which notifications are re-submitted, if the alarm
keeps firing without interruption. Format defined by ISO 8601. For
example, *PT4H* indicates four hours. Minimum: PT1M. Maximum: P30D.

Default value: null (notifications are not re-submitted).

Example:

   PT2H

--resolution [text]

The time between calculated aggregation windows for the alarm.
Supported value: *1m*

--resource-group [text]

Resource group that you want to use as a filter. The alarm retrieves
metric data associated with the specified resource group only. Only
one resource group can be applied per metric. A valid resourceGroup
value starts with an alphabetical character and includes only
alphanumeric characters, periods (.), underscores (_), hyphens (-),
and dollar signs ($). Avoid entering confidential information.

Example:

   frontend-fleet

--suppression [complex type]

The configuration details for suppressing an alarm. This is a complex
type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
string on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACTIVE, DELETED, DELETING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource to
see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by "--wait-for-
state". Defaults to 30 seconds.
