.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The properties that define a job. Jobs perform the actions that are defined in your configuration. \- \fBPlan job\fP\&. A plan job takes your Terraform configuration, parses it, and creates an execution plan. \- \fBApply job\fP\&. The apply job takes your execution plan, applies it to the associated stack, then executes the configuration\(aqs instructions. \- \fBDestroy job\fP\&. To clean up the infrastructure controlled by the stack, you run a destroy job. A destroy job does not delete the stack or associated job resources, but instead releases the resources managed by the stack. \- \fBImport_TF_State job\fP\&. An import Terraform state job takes a Terraform state file and sets it as the current state of the stack. This is used to migrate local Terraform environments to Resource Manager.

.B \-\-job\-id [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the job.
.SS Optional Parameters
.INDENT 0.0

.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP

For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
