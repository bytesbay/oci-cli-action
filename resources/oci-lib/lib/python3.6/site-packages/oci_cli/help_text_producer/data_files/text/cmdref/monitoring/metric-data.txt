Description
===========

The set of aggregated data returned for a metric. For information
about metrics, see Metrics Overview.

Limits information for returned data follows.

* Data points: 100,000. * Metric streams* within data points: 2,000.
  * Time range returned for 1-hour resolution: 90 days. * Time range
  returned for 5-minute resolution: 30 days. * Time range returned for
  any other resolution: 7 days.

>>*<<A metric stream is an individual set of aggregated data for a
metric, typically specific to a single resource. Metric streams cannot
be aggregated across metric groups. A metric group is the combination
of a given metric, metric namespace, and tenancy for the purpose of
determining limits. For more information about metric-related
