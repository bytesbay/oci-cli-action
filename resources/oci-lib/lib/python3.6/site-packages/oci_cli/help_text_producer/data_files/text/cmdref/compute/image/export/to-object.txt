"to-object"
***********


Description
===========

Exports the specified image to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object
Storage Service using the namespace, bucket name, and object name to
identify the location to export to.

For more information about exporting images, see Image Import/Export.

To perform an image export, you need write access to the Object
Storage Service bucket for the image, see Let Users Write Objects to
Object Storage Buckets.


Usage
=====

   oci compute image export to-object [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

-bn, --bucket-name [text]

The name of the bucket to export the image to.

--image-id [text]

The OCID of the image.

--name [text]

The name which will be given to the exported image object.

-ns, --namespace [text]

The Object Storage Service namespace to export the image to.


Optional Parameters
===================

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--if-match [text]

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource's
current etag value.
