Description
===========

A software-defined data center (SDDC) contains the resources required
for a functional VMware environment. Instances in an SDDC (see
EsxiHost) run in a virtual cloud network (VCN) and are preconfigured
with VMware and storage. Use the vCenter utility to manage and deploy
VMware virtual machines (VMs) in the SDDC.

The SDDC uses a single management subnet for provisioning the SDDC. It
also uses a set of VLANs for various components of the VMware
environment (vSphere, vMotion, vSAN, and so on). See the Core Services
API for information about VCN subnets and VLANs.
