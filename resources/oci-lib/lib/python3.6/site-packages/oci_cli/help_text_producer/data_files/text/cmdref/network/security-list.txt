security-list
*************


Description
===========

A set of virtual firewall rules for your VCN. Security lists are
configured at the subnet level, but the rules are applied to the
ingress and egress traffic for the individual instances in the subnet.
The rules can be stateful or stateless. For more information, see
Security Lists. **Note:** Compare security lists to
>>`<<NetworkSecurityGroup <https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaa
s/20160918/NetworkSecurityGroup/>`__s, which let you apply a set of
security rules to a *specific set of VNICs* instead of an entire
subnet. Oracle recommends using network security groups instead of
security lists, although you can use either or both together.

**Important:** Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute service images
automatically include firewall rules (for example, Linux iptables,
Windows firewall). If there are issues with some type of access to an
instance, make sure both the security lists associated with the
instance's subnet and the instance's firewall rules are set correctly.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
