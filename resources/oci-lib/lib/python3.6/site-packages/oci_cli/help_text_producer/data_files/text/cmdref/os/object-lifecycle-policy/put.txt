=====

   oci os object-lifecycle-policy put [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--bucket-name, -bn [text]

The name of the bucket. Avoid entering confidential information.
Example: *my-new-bucket1*


Optional Parameters
===================

--force

Perform update without prompting for confirmation.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--if-match [text]

The entity tag (ETag) to match. For creating and committing a
multipart upload to an object, this is the entity tag of the target
object. For uploading a part, this is the entity tag of the target
part.

--if-none-match [text]

The entity tag (ETag) to avoid matching. The only valid value is '*',
which indicates that the request should fail if the object already
exists. For creating and committing a multipart upload, this is the
entity tag of the target object. For uploading a part, this is the
entity tag of the target part.

--items [complex type]

The bucket's set of lifecycle policy rules.

This option is a JSON list with items of type ObjectLifecycleRule.
For documentation on ObjectLifecycleRule please see our API reference:
https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/objectstorage/20160918/datatyp
es/ObjectLifecycleRule. This is a complex type whose value must be
valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line
or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--namespace-name, --namespace, -ns [text]

The Object Storage namespace used for the request. If not provided,
this parameter will be obtained internally using a call to 'oci os ns
get'
