"create"
********


Description
===========

Creates a new Web Application Acceleration and Security (WAAS) policy
in the specified compartment. A WAAS policy must be established before
creating Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules. To use WAF rules, your
web application's origin servers must defined in the *WaasPolicy*
schema.

A domain name must be specified when creating a WAAS policy. The
domain name should be different from the origins specified in your
*WaasPolicy*. Once domain name is entered and stored, it is
unchangeable.

Use the record data returned in the *cname* field of the *WaasPolicy*
object to create a CNAME record in your DNS configuration that will
direct your domain's traffic through the WAF.

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
compartment where you want the service to reside. For information
about access control and compartments, see Overview of the IAM
Service.

You must specify a display name and domain for the WAAS policy. The
display name does not have to be unique and can be changed. The domain
name should be different from every origin specified in *WaasPolicy*.

All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including WAAS policies,
receive a unique, Oracle-assigned ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier
(OCID). When a resource is created, you can find its OCID in the
response. You can also retrieve a resource's OCID by using a list API
operation for that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the
Console. Fore more information, see Resource Identifiers.

**Note:** After sending the POST request, the new object's state will
temporarily be *CREATING*. Ensure that the resource's state has
changed to *ACTIVE* before use.


Usage
=====

   oci waas waas-policy create [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the compartment in which to create the WAAS policy.

--domain [text]

The web application domain that the WAAS policy protects.


Optional Parameters
===================

--additional-domains [complex type]

An array of additional domains for the specified web application. This
is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be
provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--display-name [text]

A user-friendly name for the WAAS policy. The name can be changed and
does not need to be unique.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Department": "Finance"}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--origin-groups [complex type]

The map of origin groups and their keys used to associate origins to
the *wafConfig*. Origin groups allow you to apply weights to groups of
origins for load balancing purposes. Origins with higher weights will
receive larger proportions of client requests. To add additional
origins to your WAAS policy, update the *origins* field of a
*UpdateWaasPolicy* request.

This option is a JSON dictionary of type dict(str, OriginGroup).  For
documentation on OriginGroup please see our API reference: https://do
cs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/waas/20181116/datatypes/OriginGroup. This
is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be
provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--origins [complex type]

A map of host to origin for the web application. The key should be a
customer friendly name for the host, ex. primary, secondary, etc.

This option is a JSON dictionary of type dict(str, Origin).  For
documentation on Origin please see our API reference:
https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/waas/20181116/datatypes/Origin.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in

be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--waf-config [complex type]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource
and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation.
Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work
request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified,
returning on the first state. For example, "--wait-for-state"
SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on whichever
lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code
of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACCEPTED, CANCELED, CANCELING, FAILED, IN_PROGRESS, SUCCEEDED

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the work request
to see if it has reached the state defined by "--wait-for-state".
Defaults to 30 seconds.
