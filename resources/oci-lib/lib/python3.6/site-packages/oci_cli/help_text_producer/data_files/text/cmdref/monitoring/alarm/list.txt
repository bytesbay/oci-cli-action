"list"
******


Description
===========

Lists the alarms for the specified compartment. For important limits
information, see Limits on Monitoring.

This call is subject to a Monitoring limit that applies to the total
number of requests across all alarm operations. Monitoring might
throttle this call to reject an otherwise valid request when the total
rate of alarm operations exceeds 10 requests, or transactions, per
second (TPS) for a given tenancy.


Usage
=====

   oci monitoring alarm list [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the compartment containing the resources monitored by the
metric that you are searching for. Use tenancyId to search in the root
compartment.

Example:

   ocid1.compartment.oc1..exampleuniqueID


Optional Parameters
===================

--all

Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you
cannot provide the "--limit" option.

--compartment-id-in-subtree [boolean]

When true, returns resources from all compartments and
subcompartments. The parameter can only be set to true when
compartmentId is the tenancy OCID (the tenancy is the root
compartment). A true value requires the user to have tenancy-level
permissions. If this requirement is not met, then the call is
rejected. When false, returns resources from only the compartment
specified in compartmentId. Default is false.

--display-name [text]

A filter to return only resources that match the given display name
exactly. Use this filter to list an alarm by name. Alternatively, when
you know the alarm OCID, use the GetAlarm operation.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--lifecycle-state [text]

A filter to return only alarms that match the given lifecycle state
exactly. When not specified, only alarms in the ACTIVE lifecycle state
are listed.

Accepted values are:

   ACTIVE, DELETED, DELETING

--limit [integer]

For list pagination. The maximum number of results per page, or items
to return in a paginated "List" call. For important details about how
pagination works, see List Pagination.

Default: 1000

Example:

   500

--page [text]

For list pagination. The value of the *opc-next-page* response header
from the previous "List" call. For important details about how
pagination works, see List Pagination.

--page-size [integer]

When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only
valid when used with "--all" or "--limit", and ignored otherwise.

--sort-by [text]

The field to use when sorting returned alarm definitions. Only one
sorting level is provided.

Example:

   severity

Accepted values are:

   displayName, severity

--sort-order [text]

The sort order to use when sorting returned alarm definitions.
Ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC).

Example:

   ASC

Accepted values are:

   ASC, DESC
