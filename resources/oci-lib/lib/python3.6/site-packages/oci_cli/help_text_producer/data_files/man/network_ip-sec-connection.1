.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A connection between a DRG and CPE. This connection consists of multiple IPSec tunnels. Creating this connection is one of the steps required when setting up an IPSec VPN.
.sp
\fBImportant:\fP  Each tunnel in an IPSec connection can use either static routing or BGP dynamic routing (see the \fI\%IPSecConnectionTunnel\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/IPSecConnectionTunnel/\fP> object\(aqs \fIrouting\fP attribute). Originally only static routing was supported and every IPSec connection was required to have at least one static route configured. To maintain backward compatibility in the API when support for BPG dynamic routing was introduced, the API accepts an empty list of static routes if you configure both of the IPSec tunnels to use BGP dynamic routing. If you switch a tunnel\(aqs routing from \fIBGP\fP to \fISTATIC\fP, you must first ensure that the IPSec connection is configured with at least one valid CIDR block static route. Oracle uses the IPSec connection\(aqs static routes when routing a tunnel\(aqs traffic \fIonly\fP if that tunnel\(aqs \fIrouting\fP attribute = \fISTATIC\fP\&. Otherwise the static routes are ignored.
.sp
For more information about the workflow for setting up an IPSec connection, see \fI\%IPSec VPN\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPsec.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.

.SS \fBcreate\fP
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new IPSec connection between the specified DRG and CPE. For more information, see \fI\%IPSec VPNs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPsec.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
If you configure at least one tunnel to use static routing, then in the request you must provide at least one valid static route (you\(aqre allowed a maximum of 10). For example: 10.0.0.0/16. If you configure both tunnels to use BGP dynamic routing, you can provide an empty list for the static routes. For more information, see the important note in \fI\%IPSecConnection\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/IPSecConnection/\fP>\&.
.sp
For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the IPSec connection to reside. Notice that the IPSec connection doesn\(aqt have to be in the same compartment as the DRG, CPE, or other Networking Service components. If you\(aqre not sure which compartment to use, put the IPSec connection in the same compartment as the DRG. For more information about compartments and access control, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You may optionally specify a \fIdisplay name\fP for the IPSec connection, otherwise a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.
.sp
After creating the IPSec connection, you need to configure your on\-premises router with tunnel\-specific information. For tunnel status and the required configuration information, see:

.SS Description
.sp
Deletes the specified IPSec connection.

If you were to delete all the components and then later need to create an IPSec VPN again, you would need to configure your on\-premises router again with the new information returned from \fI\%CreateIPSecConnection\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/IPSecConnection/CreateIPSecConnection\fP>\&.
.sp
This is an asynchronous operation. The connection\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP will change to TERMINATING temporarily until the connection is completely removed.

.SS \fBget\-ipsec\-cpe\-device\-config\-content\fP
.SS Description
.sp
Renders a set of CPE configuration content for the specified IPSec connection (for all the tunnels in the connection). The content helps a network engineer configure the actual CPE device (for example, a hardware router) that the specified IPSec connection terminates on.
.sp
The rendered content is specific to the type of CPE device (for example, Cisco ASA). Therefore the \fI\%Cpe\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Cpe/\fP> used by the specified \fI\%IPSecConnection\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/IPSecConnection/\fP> must have the CPE\(aqs device type specified by the \fIcpeDeviceShapeId\fP attribute. The content optionally includes answers that the customer provides (see \fI\%UpdateTunnelCpeDeviceConfig\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/TunnelCpeDeviceConfig/UpdateTunnelCpeDeviceConfig\fP>), merged with a template of other information specific to the CPE device type.
.sp
The operation returns configuration information for all tunnels in the single specified \fI\%IPSecConnection\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/IPSecConnection/\fP> object. Here are other similar operations:
