.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new file system in the specified compartment and availability domain. Instances can mount file systems in another availability domain, but doing so might increase latency when compared to mounting instances in the same availability domain.
.sp
After you create a file system, you can associate it with a mount target. Instances can then mount the file system by connecting to the mount target\(aqs IP address. You can associate a file system with more than one mount target at a time.
.sp
For information about access control and compartments, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For information about Network Security Groups access control, see \fI\%Network Security Groups\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Concepts/networksecuritygroups.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For information about availability domains, see \fI\%Regions and Availability Domains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm\fP>\&. To get a list of availability domains, use the \fIListAvailabilityDomains\fP operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
.sp
All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including file systems, get an Oracle\-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID).  When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource\(aqs OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type or by viewing the resource in the Console.

.sp
The availability domain to create the file system in.

.sp
The OCID of the compartment to create the file system in.
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-display\-name [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A user\-friendly name. It does not have to be unique, and it is changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.

.TP
.B \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair  with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{"Department": "Finance"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP

.TP
.B \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.sp
Accepted values are:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
