Description
===========

A logical subdivision of a VCN. Each subnet consists of a contiguous
range of IP addresses that do not overlap with other subnets in the
VCN. Example: 172.16.1.0/24. For more information, see Overview of the
Networking Service and VCNs and Subnets.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
