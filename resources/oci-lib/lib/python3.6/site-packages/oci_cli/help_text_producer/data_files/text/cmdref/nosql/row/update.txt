"update"
********


Description
===========

Write a single row into the table.


Usage
=====

   oci nosql row update [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--table-name-or-id [text]

A table name within the compartment, or a table OCID.

--value [complex type]

The map of values from a row. This is a complex type whose value must
be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command
line or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.


Optional Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the table's compartment.  Required if the tableNameOrId
path parameter is a table name. Optional if tableNameOrId is an OCID.
If tableNameOrId is an OCID, and compartmentId is supplied, the latter
must match the identified table's compartmentId.

--force

Perform update without prompting for confirmation.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--identity-cache-size [integer]

Sets the number of generated identity values that are requested from
the server during a put. If present and greater than 0, this value
takes precedence over a default value for the table.

--if-match [text]

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource. The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource's
current etag value.

--is-exact-match [boolean]

If present and true, the presented row value must exactly match the
table's schema.  Otherwise, rows with missing non-key fields or extra
fields can be written successfully.

--is-get-return-row [boolean]

If true, and the put fails due to an option setting, then the existing
row will be returned.

--option [text]

Specifies a condition for the put operation.

Accepted values are:

   IF_ABSENT, IF_PRESENT

--timeout-in-ms [integer]

Timeout setting for the put.

--ttl [integer]

Time-to-live for the row, in days.

--ttl-use-default [boolean]

If true, set time-to-live for this row to the table's default.
