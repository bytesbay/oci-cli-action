.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Re\-encrypts the unique data encryption key that encrypts each object written to the bucket by using the most recent version of the master encryption key assigned to the bucket. (All data encryption keys are encrypted by a master encryption key. Master encryption keys are assigned to buckets and managed by Oracle by default, but you can assign a key that you created and control through the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Key Management service.) The kmsKeyId property of the bucket determines which master encryption key is assigned to the bucket. If you assigned a different Key Management master encryption key to the bucket, you can call this API to re\-encrypt all data encryption keys with the newly assigned key. Similarly, you might want to re\-encrypt all data encryption keys if the assigned key has been rotated to a new key version since objects were last added to the bucket. If you call this API and there is no kmsKeyId associated with the bucket, the call will fail.
.sp
Calling this API starts a work request task to re\-encrypt the data encryption key of all objects in the bucket. Only objects created before the time of the API call will be re\-encrypted. The call can take a long time, depending on how many objects are in the bucket and how big they are. This API returns a work request ID that you can use to retrieve the status of the work request task. All the versions of objects will be re\-encrypted whether versioning is enabled or suspended at the bucket.

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-bucket\-name, \-bn [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The name of the bucket. Avoid entering confidential information. Example: \fImy\-new\-bucket1\fP
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state defined by \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP\&. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-namespace\-name, \-\-namespace, \-ns [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The Object Storage namespace used for the request. If not provided, this parameter will be obtained internally using a call to \(aqoci os ns get\(aq
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.

Accepted values are:

.sp
Check every \fB\-\-wait\-interval\-seconds\fP to see whether the work request to see if it has reached the state defined by \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP\&. Defaults to 30 seconds.
