"list"
******


Description
===========

Gets a list of Budgets in a compartment.

By default, ListBudgets returns budgets of 'COMPARTMENT' target type
and the budget records with only ONE target compartment OCID.

To list ALL budgets, set the targetType query parameter to ALL.
Example:   'targetType=ALL'

Additional targetTypes would be available in future releases. Clients
should ignore new targetType or upgrade to latest version of client
SDK to handle new targetType.


Usage
=====

   oci budgets budget list [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The ID of the compartment in which to list resources.


Optional Parameters
===================

--all

Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you
cannot provide the "--limit" option.

--display-name [text]

A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable.

Example:

   My new resource

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
