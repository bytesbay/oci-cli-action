"complete"
**********


Description
===========

Changes the status of the standalone backup resource to *ACTIVE* after
the backup is created from the on-premises database and placed in
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage.

**Note:** This API is used by an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Python
script that is packaged with the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI.
Oracle recommends that you use the script instead using the API
directly. See Migrating an On-Premises Database to Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure by Creating a Backup in the Cloud for more information.


Usage
=====

   oci db external-backup-job complete [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--backup-id [text]

The backup OCID.


Optional Parameters
===================

--cf-backup-handle [text]

The handle of the control file backup.

--data-size [integer]

The size of the data in the database, in megabytes.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--if-match [text]

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource's
current etag value.

--redo-size [integer]

The size of the redo in the database, in megabytes.

--spf-backup-handle [text]

The handle of the spfile backup.

--sql-patches [complex type]

The list of SQL patches that need to be applied to the backup during
the restore. This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON.
The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in
as a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--tde-wallet-path [text]

If the database being backed up is TDE enabled, this will be the path
to the associated TDE wallet in Object Storage.
