.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
An individual employee or system that needs to manage or use your company\(aqs Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users might need to launch instances, manage remote disks, work with your cloud network, etc. Users have one or more IAM Service credentials (\fI\%ApiKey\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/ApiKey/\fP>, \fI\%UIPassword\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/UIPassword/\fP>, \fI\%SwiftPassword\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/SwiftPassword/\fP> and \fI\%AuthToken\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/AuthToken/\fP>). For more information, see \fI\%User Credentials\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/usercredentials.htm\fP>). End users of your application are not typically IAM Service users. For conceptual information about users and other IAM Service components, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
These users are created directly within the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure system, via the IAM service. They are different from \fIfederated users\fP, who authenticate themselves to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console via an identity provider. For more information, see \fI\%Identity Providers and Federation\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/federation.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBWarning:\fP Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential information when you supply string values using the API.

.SS api\-key
.SS Description
.sp
A PEM\-format RSA credential for securing requests to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure REST API. Also known as an \fIAPI signing key\fP\&. Specifically, this is the public key from the key pair. The private key remains with the user calling the API. For information about generating a key pair in the required PEM format, see \fI\%Required Keys and OCIDs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
\fBImportant:\fP This is \fBnot\fP the SSH key for accessing compute instances.
.sp
Each user can have a maximum of three API signing keys.
.sp
For more information about user credentials, see \fI\%User Credentials\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/usercredentials.htm\fP>\&.

.SS Description
.sp
Deletes the specified API signing key for the specified user.
.sp
Every user has permission to use this operation to delete a key for \fItheir own user ID\fP\&. An administrator in your organization does not need to write a policy to give users this ability. To compare, administrators who have permission to the tenancy can use this operation to delete a key for any user, including themselves.

To compare, administrators who have permission to the tenancy can use this operation to upload a key for any user, including themselves.
.sp
\fBImportant:\fP Even though you have permission to upload an API key, you might not yet have permission to do much else. If you try calling an operation unrelated to your own credential management (e.g., \fIListUsers\fP, \fILaunchInstance\fP) and receive an "unauthorized" error, check with an administrator to confirm which IAM Service group(s) you\(aqre in and what access you have. Also confirm you\(aqre working in the correct compartment.
.sp
After you send your request, the new object\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP will temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its \fIlifecycleState\fP has changed to ACTIVE.

.SS \fBcreate\fP
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new user in your tenancy. For conceptual information about users, your tenancy, and other IAM Service components, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must specify your tenancy\(aqs OCID as the compartment ID in the request object (remember that the tenancy is simply the root compartment). Notice that IAM resources (users, groups, compartments, and some policies) reside within the tenancy itself, unlike cloud resources such as compute instances, which typically reside within compartments inside the tenancy. For information about OCIDs, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIname\fP for the user, which must be unique across all users in your tenancy and cannot be changed. Allowed characters: No spaces. Only letters, numerals, hyphens, periods, underscores, +, and @. If you specify a name that\(aqs already in use, you\(aqll get a 409 error. This name will be the user\(aqs login to the Console. You might want to pick a name that your company\(aqs own identity system (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP, etc.) already uses. If you delete a user and then create a new user with the same name, they\(aqll be considered different users because they have different OCIDs.
.sp
You must also specify a \fIdescription\fP for the user (although it can be an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it anytime with \fI\%UpdateUser\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/User/UpdateUser\fP>\&. You can use the field to provide the user\(aqs full name, a description, a nickname, or other information to generally identify the user.
.sp
After you send your request, the new object\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP will temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its \fIlifecycleState\fP has changed to ACTIVE.
.sp
A new user has no permissions until you place the user in one or more groups (see \fI\%AddUserToGroup\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/UserGroupMembership/AddUserToGroup\fP>). If the user needs to access the Console, you need to provide the user a password (see \fI\%CreateOrResetUIPassword\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/UIPassword/CreateOrResetUIPassword\fP>). If the user needs to access the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure REST API, you need to upload a public API signing key for that user (see \fI\%Required Keys and OCIDs\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm\fP> and also \fI\%UploadApiKey\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/ApiKey/UploadApiKey\fP>).
.sp
\fBImportant:\fP Make sure to inform the new user which compartment(s) they have access to.

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
