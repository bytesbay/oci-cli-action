"create"
********


Description
===========

Creates a new tag in the specified tag namespace.

The tag requires either the OCID or the name of the tag namespace that
will contain this tag definition.

You must specify a *name* for the tag, which must be unique across all
tags in the tag namespace and cannot be changed. The name can contain
any ASCII character except the space (_) or period (.) characters.
Names are case insensitive. That means, for example, "myTag" and
"mytag" are not allowed in the same namespace. If you specify a name
that's already in use in the tag namespace, a 409 error is returned.

The tag must have a *description*. It does not have to be unique, and
you can change it with UpdateTag.

The tag must have a value type, which is specified with a validator.
Tags can use either a static value or a list of possible values.
Static values are entered by a user applying the tag to a resource.
Lists are created by you and the user must apply a value from the
list. Lists are validiated.

* If no *validator* is set, the user applying the tag to a resource
  can type in a static value or leave the tag value empty. * If a
  *validator* is set, the user applying the tag to a resource must
  select from a list of values that you supply with
  EnumTagDefinitionValidator.


Usage
=====

   oci iam tag create [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--description [text]

The description you assign to the tag during creation.

--name [text]

The name you assign to the tag during creation. This is the tag key
definition. The name must be unique within the tag namespace and
cannot be changed.

--tag-namespace-id [text]

The OCID of the tag namespace.


Optional Parameters
===================

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Department": "Finance"}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--is-cost-tracking [boolean]

Indicates whether the tag is enabled for cost tracking.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--validator [complex type]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACTIVE, DELETED, DELETING, INACTIVE

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource to
see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by "--wait-for-
state". Defaults to 30 seconds.
