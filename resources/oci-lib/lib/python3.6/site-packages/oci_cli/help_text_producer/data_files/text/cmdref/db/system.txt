Description
===========

The Database Service supports several types of DB systems, ranging in
size, price, and performance. For details about each type of system,
see: - Exadata DB Systems - Bare Metal and Virtual Machine DB Systems
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you are not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you
are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access,
see Getting Started with Policies. For information about access
control and compartments, see Overview of the Identity Service. For
information about availability domains, see [Regions and Availability
Domains]. To get a list of availability domains, use the
*ListAvailabilityDomains* operation in the Identity Service API.
**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
