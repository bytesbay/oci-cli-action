service-gateway
***************


Description
===========

Represents a router that lets your VCN privately access specific
Oracle services such as Object Storage without exposing the VCN to the
public internet. Traffic leaving the VCN and destined for a supported
Oracle service (see ListServices) is routed through the service
gateway and does not traverse the internet. The instances in the VCN
do not need to have public IP addresses nor be in a public subnet. The
VCN does not need an internet gateway for this traffic. For more
information, see Access to Oracle Services: Service Gateway.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
