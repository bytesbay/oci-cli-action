vnic
****


Description
===========

A virtual network interface card. Each VNIC resides in a subnet in a
VCN. An instance attaches to a VNIC to obtain a network connection
into the VCN through that subnet. Each instance has a *primary VNIC*
that is automatically created and attached during launch. You can add
*secondary VNICs* to an instance after it's launched. For more
information, see Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs).

Each VNIC has a *primary private IP* that is automatically assigned
during launch. You can add *secondary private IPs* to a VNIC after
it's created. For more information, see CreatePrivateIp and IP
Addresses.

   If you are an Oracle Cloud VMware Solution customer, you will have
   secondary VNICs that reside in a VLAN instead of a subnet. These
   VNICs have other differences, which are called out in the
   descriptions of the relevant attributes in the *Vnic* object. Also
   see Vlan.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
