"create"
********


Description
===========

Creates a new subnet in the specified VCN. You can't change the size
of the subnet after creation, so it's important to think about the
size of subnets you need before creating them. For more information,
see VCNs and Subnets. For information on the number of subnets you can
have in a VCN, see Service Limits.

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
compartment where you want the subnet to reside. Notice that the
subnet doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the VCN, route
tables, or other Networking Service components. If you're not sure
which compartment to use, put the subnet in the same compartment as
the VCN. For more information about compartments and access control,
see Overview of the IAM Service. For information about OCIDs, see
Resource Identifiers.

You may optionally associate a route table with the subnet. If you
don't, the subnet will use the VCN's default route table. For more
information about route tables, see Route Tables.

You may optionally associate a security list with the subnet. If you
don't, the subnet will use the VCN's default security list. For more
information about security lists, see Security Lists.

You may optionally associate a set of DHCP options with the subnet. If
you don't, the subnet will use the VCN's default set. For more
information about DHCP options, see DHCP Options.

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the subnet, otherwise
a default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can
change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

You can also add a DNS label for the subnet, which is required if you
want the Internet and VCN Resolver to resolve hostnames for instances
in the subnet. For more information, see DNS in Your Virtual Cloud
Network.


Usage
=====

   oci network subnet create [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--cidr-block [text]

The CIDR IP address range of the subnet. The CIDR must maintain the
following rules -

1. The CIDR block is valid and correctly formatted. b. The new
   range is within one of the parent VCN ranges.

Example:

   10.0.1.0/24

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the compartment to contain the subnet.

--vcn-id [text]

The OCID of the VCN to contain the subnet.


Optional Parameters
===================

--availability-domain [text]

Controls whether the subnet is regional or specific to an availability
domain. Oracle recommends creating regional subnets because they're
more flexible and make it easier to implement failover across
availability domains. Originally, AD-specific subnets were the only
kind available to use.

To create a regional subnet, omit this attribute. Then any resources
later created in this subnet (such as a Compute instance) can be
created in any availability domain in the region.

To instead create an AD-specific subnet, set this attribute to the
availability domain you want this subnet to be in. Then any resources
later created in this subnet can only be created in that availability
domain.

Example:

   Uocm:PHX-AD-1

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--dhcp-options-id [text]

The OCID of the set of DHCP options the subnet will use. If you don't
provide a value, the subnet uses the VCN's default set of DHCP
options.

--display-name [text]

A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable.
Avoid entering confidential information.

--dns-label [text]

A DNS label for the subnet, used in conjunction with the VNIC's
hostname and VCN's DNS label to form a fully qualified domain name
(FQDN) for each VNIC within this subnet (for example,
*bminstance-1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com*). Must be an alphanumeric
string that begins with a letter and is unique within the VCN. The
value cannot be changed.

This value must be set if you want to use the Internet and VCN
Resolver to resolve the hostnames of instances in the subnet. It can
only be set if the VCN itself was created with a DNS label.

For more information, see DNS in Your Virtual Cloud Network.

Example:

   subnet123

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Department": "Finance"}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--ipv6-cidr-block [text]

Use this to enable IPv6 addressing for this subnet. The VCN must be
enabled for IPv6. You can't change this subnet characteristic later.
All subnets are /64 in size. The subnet portion of the IPv6 address is
the fourth hextet from the left (1111 in the following example).

For important details about IPv6 addressing in a VCN, see IPv6
Addresses.

Example:

   2001:0db8:0123:1111::/64

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--prohibit-public-ip-on-vnic [boolean]

Whether VNICs within this subnet can have public IP addresses.
Defaults to false, which means VNICs created in this subnet will
automatically be assigned public IP addresses unless specified
otherwise during instance launch (with the *--assign-public-ip* flag).
If *--prohibit-public-ip-on-vnic* is set to true, VNICs created in
this subnet cannot have public IP addresses (i.e., it's a private
subnet).

Example:

   true

--route-table-id [text]

The OCID of the route table the subnet will use. If you don't provide
a value, the subnet uses the VCN's default route table.

--security-list-ids [complex type]

The OCIDs of the security list or lists the subnet will use. If you
don't provide a value, the subnet uses the VCN's default security
list. Remember that security lists are associated *with the subnet*,
but the rules are applied to the individual VNICs in the subnet. This
is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be
provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

Example:

   '["ocid1.securitylist.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaadyndu2n3hcmdsjfiljwyq7vpxsvv7ynp4ori7aealcvhzicnzhyq"]'

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   AVAILABLE, PROVISIONING, TERMINATED, TERMINATING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource to
see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by "--wait-for-
state". Defaults to 30 seconds.
