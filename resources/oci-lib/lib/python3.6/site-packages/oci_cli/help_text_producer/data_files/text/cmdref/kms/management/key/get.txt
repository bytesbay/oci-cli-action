"get"
*****


Description
===========

Gets information about the specified master encryption key.

As a management operation, this call is subject to a Key Management
limit that applies to the total number of requests across all
management read operations. Key Management might throttle this call to
reject an otherwise valid request when the total rate of management
read operations exceeds 10 requests per second for a given tenancy.

The top level --endpoint parameter must be supplied for this
operation.


Usage
=====

   oci kms management key get [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--key-id [text]

The OCID of the key.


Optional Parameters
===================

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
