"create"
********


Description
===========

Creates a new virtual customer-premises equipment (CPE) object in the
specified compartment. For more information, see IPSec VPNs.

For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the
compartment where you want the CPE to reside. Notice that the CPE
doesn't have to be in the same compartment as the IPSec connection or
other Networking Service components. If you're not sure which
compartment to use, put the CPE in the same compartment as the DRG.
For more information about compartments and access control, see
Overview of the IAM Service. For information about OCIDs, see Resource
Identifiers.

You must provide the public IP address of your on-premises router. See
Configuring Your On-Premises Router for an IPSec VPN.

You may optionally specify a *display name* for the CPE, otherwise a
default is provided. It does not have to be unique, and you can change
it. Avoid entering confidential information.


Usage
=====

   oci network cpe create [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the compartment to contain the CPE.

--ip-address [text]

The public IP address of the on-premises router.

Example:

   203.0.113.2


Optional Parameters
===================

--cpe-device-shape-id [text]

The OCID of the CPE device type. You can provide a value if you want
to later generate CPE device configuration content for IPSec
connections that use this CPE. You can also call UpdateCpe later to
provide a value. For a list of possible values, see
ListCpeDeviceShapes.

For more information about generating CPE device configuration
content, see:

   * GetCpeDeviceConfigContent   * GetIpsecCpeDeviceConfigContent
     * GetTunnelCpeDeviceConfigContent   * GetTunnelCpeDeviceConfig

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--display-name [text]

A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable.
Avoid entering confidential information.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Department": "Finance"}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
