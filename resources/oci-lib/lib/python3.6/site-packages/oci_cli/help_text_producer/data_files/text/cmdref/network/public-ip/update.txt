"update"
********


Description
===========

Updates the specified public IP. You must specify the object's OCID.
Use this operation if you want to:

* Assign a reserved public IP in your pool to a private IP. * Move a
  reserved public IP to a different private IP. * Unassign a reserved
  public IP from a private IP (which returns it to your pool of
  reserved public IPs). * Change the display name or tags for a public
  IP.

Assigning, moving, and unassigning a reserved public IP are
asynchronous operations. Poll the public IP's *lifecycleState* to
determine if the operation succeeded.

**Note:** When moving a reserved public IP, the target private IP must
not already have a public IP with *lifecycleState* = ASSIGNING or
ASSIGNED. If it does, an error is returned. Also, the initial
unassignment from the original private IP always succeeds, but the
assignment to the target private IP is asynchronous and could fail
silently (for example, if the target private IP is deleted or has a
different public IP assigned to it in the interim). If that occurs,
the public IP remains unassigned and its *lifecycleState* switches to
AVAILABLE (it is not reassigned to its original private IP). You must
poll the public IP's *lifecycleState* to determine if the move
succeeded.

Regarding ephemeral public IPs:

* If you want to assign an ephemeral public IP to a primary private
  IP, use CreatePublicIp. * You can't move an ephemeral public IP to a
  different private IP. * If you want to unassign an ephemeral public
  IP from its private IP, use DeletePublicIp, which unassigns and
  deletes the ephemeral public IP.

**Note:** If a public IP is assigned to a secondary private IP (see
PrivateIp), and you move that secondary private IP to another VNIC,
the public IP moves with it.

**Note:** There's a limit to the number of public IPs a VNIC or
instance can have. If you try to move a reserved public IP to a VNIC
or instance that has already reached its public IP limit, an error is
returned. For information about the public IP limits, see Public IP
Addresses.


Usage
=====

   oci network public-ip update [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--public-ip-id [text]

The OCID of the public IP.


Optional Parameters
===================

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--display-name [text]

A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable.
Avoid entering confidential information.

--force

Perform update without prompting for confirmation.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Department": "Finance"}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--if-match [text]

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource's
current etag value.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--private-ip-id [text]

The OCID of the private IP to assign the public IP to. * If the public
IP is already assigned to a different private IP, it will be
unassigned and then reassigned to the specified private IP. * If you
set this field to an empty string, the public IP will be unassigned
from the private IP it is currently assigned to.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ASSIGNED, ASSIGNING, AVAILABLE, PROVISIONING, TERMINATED, TERMINATING, UNASSIGNED, UNASSIGNING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource to
see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by "--wait-for-
state". Defaults to 30 seconds.
