"list"
******


Description
===========

Lists the compartments in a specified compartment. The members of the
list returned depends on the values set for several parameters.

With the exception of the tenancy (root compartment), the
ListCompartments operation returns only the first-level child
compartments in the parent compartment specified in *compartmentId*.
The list does not include any subcompartments of the child
compartments (grandchildren).

The parameter *accessLevel* specifies whether to return only those
compartments for which the requestor has INSPECT permissions on at
least one resource directly or indirectly (the resource can be in a
subcompartment).

The parameter *compartmentIdInSubtree* applies only when you perform
ListCompartments on the tenancy (root compartment). When set to true,
the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned. To get a full
list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root
compartment), set the parameter *compartmentIdInSubtree* to true and
*accessLevel* to ANY.

See Where to Get the Tenancy's OCID and User's OCID.


Usage
=====

   oci iam compartment list [OPTIONS]


Optional Parameters
===================

--access-level [text]

Valid values are *ANY* and *ACCESSIBLE*. Default is *ANY*. Setting
this to *ACCESSIBLE* returns only those compartments for which the
user has INSPECT permissions directly or indirectly (permissions can
be on a resource in a subcompartment). For the compartments on which
the user indirectly has INSPECT permissions, a restricted set of
fields is returned.

When set to *ANY* permissions are not checked.

Accepted values are:

   ACCESSIBLE, ANY

--all

Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you
cannot provide the "--limit" option.

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the compartment (remember that the tenancy is simply the
root compartment). If not provided, this parameter will use the
tenancy's OCID (root compartment's OCID) from the config file.

--compartment-id-in-subtree [boolean]

Default is false. Can only be set to true when performing
ListCompartments on the tenancy (root compartment). When set to true,
the hierarchy of compartments is traversed and all compartments and
subcompartments in the tenancy are returned depending on the the
setting of *accessLevel*.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--lifecycle-state [text]

A filter to only return resources that match the given lifecycle
state.  The state value is case-insensitive.

Accepted values are:

   ACTIVE, CREATING, DELETED, DELETING, INACTIVE

--limit [integer]

The maximum number of items to return in a paginated "List" call.

--name [text]

A filter to only return resources that match the given name exactly.

--page [text]

The value of the *opc-next-page* response header from the previous
"List" call.

--page-size [integer]

When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only
valid when used with "--all" or "--limit", and ignored otherwise.

--sort-by [text]

The field to sort by. You can provide one sort order (*sortOrder*).
Default order for TIMECREATED is descending. Default order for NAME is
ascending. The NAME sort order is case sensitive.

**Note:** In general, some "List" operations (for example,
*ListInstances*) let you optionally filter by Availability Domain if
the scope of the resource type is within a single Availability Domain.
If you call one of these "List" operations without specifying an
Availability Domain, the resources are grouped by Availability Domain,
then sorted.

Accepted values are:

   NAME, TIMECREATED

--sort-order [text]

The sort order to use, either ascending (*ASC*) or descending
(*DESC*). The NAME sort order is case sensitive.

Accepted values are:

   ASC, DESC

--include-root

Include root compartment
