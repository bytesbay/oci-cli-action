Description
===========

**Deprecated. Use `AuthToken <https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/
identity/20160918/AuthToken/>`__ instead.**

Swift is the OpenStack object storage service. A *SwiftPassword* is an
Oracle-provided password for using a Swift client with the Object
Storage Service. This password is associated with the user's Console
login. Swift passwords never expire. A user can have up to two Swift
passwords at a time.

**Note:** The password is always an Oracle-generated string; you can't
change it to a string of your choice.
