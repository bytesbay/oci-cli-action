Description
===========

Creates a new Data Guard association.  A Data Guard association
represents the replication relationship between the specified database
and a peer database. For more information, see Using Oracle Data
Guard.

All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including Data Guard
associations, get an Oracle-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud
Identifier (OCID). When you create a resource, you can find its OCID
in the response. You can also retrieve a resource's OCID by using a
List API operation on that resource type, or by viewing the resource
in the Console. Fore more information, see Resource Identifiers.
