.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Uploads an API signing key for the specified user.
.sp
Every user has permission to use this operation to upload a key for \fItheir own user ID\fP\&. An administrator in your organization does not need to write a policy to give users this ability. To compare, administrators who have permission to the tenancy can use this operation to upload a key for any user, including themselves.
.sp
\fBImportant:\fP Even though you have permission to upload an API key, you might not yet have permission to do much else. If you try calling an operation unrelated to your own credential management (e.g., \fIListUsers\fP, \fILaunchInstance\fP) and receive an "unauthorized" error, check with an administrator to confirm which IAM Service group(s) you\(aqre in and what access you have. Also confirm you\(aqre working in the correct compartment.
.sp
After you send your request, the new object\(aqs \fIlifecycleState\fP will temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its \fIlifecycleState\fP has changed to ACTIVE.

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-user\-id [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCID of the user.
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
