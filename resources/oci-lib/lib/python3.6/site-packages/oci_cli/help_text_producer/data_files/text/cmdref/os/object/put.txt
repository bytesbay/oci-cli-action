"put"
*****


Description
===========

Creates a new object or overwrites an existing one.

The object can be uploaded as a single part or as multiple parts.
Below are the rules for whether an object will be uploaded via single
or multipart upload (listed in order of precedence):

   * If the object is being uploaded from STDIN, it will be uploaded
     as a multipart upload (if the object content is smaller than
     --part-size, default for STDIN is 10 MiB, the multipart upload
     may contain only one part, but it will still use the
     MultipartUpload API)

   * If the --no-multipart flag is specified, the object will be
     uploaded as a single part regardless of size (specifying --no-
     multipart when uploading from STDIN will result in an error)

   * If the object is larger than --part-size, it will be uploaded
     as multiple parts

   * If the object is empty it will be uploaded as a single part

Example:
   oci os object put -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --name myfile.txt
   --file /Users/me/myfile.txt --metadata
   '{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"}'


Usage
=====

   oci os object put [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

-bn, --bucket-name [text]

The name of the bucket.

--file [filename]

The file to load as the content of the object, or '-' to read from
STDIN.


Optional Parameters
===================

--cache-control [text]

The optional Cache-Control header that defines the caching behavior
value to be returned in GetObject and HeadObject responses. Specifying
values for this header has no effect on Object Storage behavior.
Programs that read the object determine what to do based on the value
provided. For example, you could use this header to identify objects
that require caching restrictions.

--content-disposition [text]

The optional Content-Disposition header that defines presentational
information for the object to be returned in GetObject and HeadObject
responses. Specifying values for this header has no effect on Object
Storage behavior. Programs that read the object determine what to do
based on the value provided. For example, you could use this header to
let users download objects with custom filenames in a browser.

--content-encoding [text]

The optional Content-Encoding header that defines the content
encodings that were applied to the object to upload. Specifying values
for this header has no effect on Object Storage behavior. Programs
that read the object determine what to do based on the value provided.
For example, you could use this header to determine what decoding
mechanisms need to be applied to obtain the media-type specified by
the Content-Type header of the object.

--content-language [text]

The optional Content-Language header that defines the content language
of the object to upload. Specifying values for this header has no
effect on Object Storage behavior. Programs that read the object
determine what to do based on the value provided. For example, you
could use this header to identify and differentiate objects based on a
particular language.

--content-md5 [text]

The optional base-64 header that defines the encoded MD5 hash of the
body. If the optional Content-MD5 header is present, Object Storage
performs an integrity check on the body of the HTTP request by
computing the MD5 hash for the body and comparing it to the MD5 hash
supplied in the header. If the two hashes do not match, the object is
rejected and an HTTP-400 Unmatched Content MD5 error is returned with
the message: "The computed MD5 of the request body (ACTUAL_MD5) does
not match the Content-MD5 header (HEADER_MD5)"

--content-type [text]

The optional Content-Type header that defines the standard MIME type
format of the object. Content type defaults to 'application/octet-
stream' if not specified in the PutObject call. Specifying values for
this header has no effect on Object Storage behavior. Programs that
read the object determine what to do based on the value provided. For
example, you could use this header to identify and perform special
operations on text only objects.

--disable-parallel-uploads

If the object will be uploaded in multiple parts, this option disables
those parts from being uploaded in parallel.

--encryption-key-file [filename]

A file containing the base64-encoded string of the AES-256 encryption
key associated with the object.

--force

If the object name already exists, overwrite the existing object
without a confirmation prompt.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--if-match [text]

The entity tag to match.

--metadata [text]

Arbitrary string keys and values for user-defined metadata. Must be in
JSON format. Example: '{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"}'

--name [text]

The name of the object. Default value is the filename excluding the
path. Required if reading object from STDIN.

-ns, --namespace, --namespace-name [text]

The top-level namespace used for the request. If not provided, this
parameter will be obtained internally using a call to 'oci os ns get'

--no-multipart

Do not use multipart uploads to upload the file in parts. By default
files above 128 MiB will be uploaded in multiple parts, then combined
server-side.

--no-overwrite

If the object name already exists, do not overwrite the existing
object.

--parallel-upload-count [integer range]

If the object will be uploaded in multiple parts, this option allows
you to specify the maximum number of parts that can be uploaded in
parallel. This option cannot be used with --disable-parallel-uploads
or --no-multipart. Defaults to 3 and the maximum is 1000.

--part-size [integer]

Part size (in MiB) to use when uploading objects using multipart
upload operations. The default part size is 128 MiB.

--verify-checksum

Verify the checksum of the uploaded object with the local file.
