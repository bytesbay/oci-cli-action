.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Updates certain fields on the specified instance. Fields that are not provided in the request will not be updated. Avoid entering confidential information.
.sp
Changes to metadata fields will be reflected in the instance metadata service (this may take up to a minute).
.sp
The OCID of the instance remains the same.

The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.

.B \-\-extended\-metadata [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Additional metadata key/value pairs that you provide. They serve the same purpose and functionality as fields in the \fImetadata\fP object.
.sp
They are distinguished from \fImetadata\fP fields in that these can be nested JSON objects (whereas \fImetadata\fP fields are string/string maps only).
.sp
The "user_data" field and the "ssh_authorized_keys" field cannot be changed after an instance has launched. Any request that updates, removes, or adds either of these fields will be rejected. You must provide the same values for "user_data" and "ssh_authorized_keys" that already exist on the instance.
.sp
The combined size of the \fImetadata\fP and \fIextendedMetadata\fP objects can be a maximum of 32,000 bytes.

.B \-\-fault\-domain [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. Each availability domain contains three fault domains. Fault domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or Compute hardware maintenance that affects one fault domain does not affect instances in other fault domains.
.sp
To get a list of fault domains, use the \fI\%ListFaultDomains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/FaultDomain/ListFaultDomains\fP> operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.

.B \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]

.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.

.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-if\-match [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.

.B \-\-launch\-options [complex type]

.B \-\-metadata [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp

.sp
The "user_data" field and the "ssh_authorized_keys" field cannot be changed after an instance has launched. Any request that updates, removes, or adds either of these fields will be rejected. You must provide the same values for "user_data" and "ssh_authorized_keys" that already exist on the instance.

.B \-\-shape [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The shape of the instance. The shape determines the number of CPUs and the amount of memory allocated to the instance. For more information about how to change shapes, and a list of shapes that are supported, see \fI\%Editing an Instance\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/Tasks/resizinginstances.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For details about the CPUs, memory, and other properties of each shape, see \fI\%Compute Shapes\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
The new shape must be compatible with the image that was used to launch the instance. You can enumerate all available shapes and determine image compatibility by calling \fI\%ListShapes\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Shape/ListShapes\fP>\&.
.sp
If the instance is running when you change the shape, the instance is rebooted.

.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
