cross-connect-group
*******************


Description
===========

For use with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect. A cross-connect
group is a link aggregation group (LAG), which can contain one or more
CrossConnects. Customers who are colocated with Oracle in a
FastConnect location create and use cross-connect groups. For more
information, see FastConnect Overview.

**Note:** If you're a provider who is setting up a physical connection
to Oracle so customers can use FastConnect over the connection, be
aware that your connection is modeled the same way as a colocated
customer's (with *CrossConnect* and *CrossConnectGroup* objects, and
so on).

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
