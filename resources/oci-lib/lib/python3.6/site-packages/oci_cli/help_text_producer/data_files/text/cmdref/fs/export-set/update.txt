"update"
********


Description
===========

Updates the specified export set's information.


Usage
=====

   oci fs export-set update [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--export-set-id [text]

The OCID of the export set.


Optional Parameters
===================

--display-name [text]

A user-friendly name. It does not have to be unique, and it is
changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.

Example:

   My export set

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--if-match [text]

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource. The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource's
current etag value.

--max-fs-stat-bytes [integer]

Controls the maximum *tbytes*, *fbytes*, and *abytes* values reported
by *NFS FSSTAT* calls through any associated mount targets. This is an
advanced feature. For most applications, use the default value. The
*tbytes* value reported by *FSSTAT* will be *maxFsStatBytes*. The
value of *fbytes* and *abytes* will be *maxFsStatBytes* minus the
metered size of the file system. If the metered size is larger than
*maxFsStatBytes*, then *fbytes* and *abytes* will both be '0'.

--max-fs-stat-files [integer]

Controls the maximum *ffiles*, *ffiles*, and *afiles* values reported
by *NFS FSSTAT* calls through any associated mount targets. This is an
advanced feature. For most applications, use the default value. The
*tfiles* value reported by *FSSTAT* will be *maxFsStatFiles*. The
value of *ffiles* and *afiles* will be *maxFsStatFiles* minus the
metered size of the file system. If the metered size is larger than
*maxFsStatFiles*, then *ffiles* and *afiles* will both be '0'.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACTIVE, CREATING, DELETED, DELETING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource to
see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by "--wait-for-
state". Defaults to 30 seconds.
