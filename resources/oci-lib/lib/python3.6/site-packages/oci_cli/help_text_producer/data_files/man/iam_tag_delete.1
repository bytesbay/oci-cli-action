.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes the specified tag definition. This operation triggers a process that removes the tag from all resources in your tenancy.
.sp
These things happen immediately: \    * If the tag was a cost\-tracking tag, it no longer counts against your 10 cost\-tracking   tags limit, whether you first disabled it or not.   * If the tag was used with dynamic groups, none of the rules that contain the tag will   be evaluated against the tag.
.sp
When you start the delete operation, the state of the tag changes to DELETING and tag removal from resources begins. This can take up to 48 hours depending on the number of resources that were tagged as well as the regions in which those resources reside.
.sp
When all tags have been removed, the state changes to DELETED. You cannot restore a deleted tag. Once the deleted tag changes its state to DELETED, you can use the same tag name again.
.sp
After you start this operation, you cannot start either the \fI\%BulkDeleteTags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/Tag/BulkDeleteTags\fP> or the \fI\%CascadeDeleteTagNamespace\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/TagNamespace/CascadeDeleteTagNamespace\fP> operation until this process completes.
.sp
To delete a tag, you must first retire it. Use \fI\%UpdateTag\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/Tag/UpdateTag\fP> to retire a tag.

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-tag\-name [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The name of the tag.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-tag\-namespace\-id [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCID of the tag namespace.
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-force
.UNINDENT
.sp
Perform deletion without prompting for confirmation.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-if\-match [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the \fIif\-match\fP parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state defined by \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP\&. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.sp
Accepted values are:

.sp
Check every \fB\-\-wait\-interval\-seconds\fP to see whether the work request to see if it has reached the state defined by \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP\&. Defaults to 30 seconds.
