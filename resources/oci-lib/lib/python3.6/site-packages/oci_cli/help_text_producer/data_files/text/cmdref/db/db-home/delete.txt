"delete"
********


Description
===========

Deletes a Database Home. Applies to bare metal DB systems, Exadata DB
systems, and Exadata Cloud at Customer systems.

Oracle recommends that you use the *performFinalBackup* parameter to
back up any data on a bare metal DB system before you delete a
Database Home. On an Exadata Cloud at Customer system or an Exadata DB
system, you can delete a Database Home only when there are no
databases in it and therefore you cannot use the *performFinalBackup*
parameter to back up data.


Usage
=====

   oci db db-home delete [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--db-home-id [text]

The Database Home OCID.


Optional Parameters
===================

--force

Perform deletion without prompting for confirmation.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--if-match [text]

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource's
current etag value.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--perform-final-backup [boolean]

Whether to perform a final backup of the database or not. Default is
false.

If you previously used RMAN or dbcli to configure backups and then you
switch to using the Console or the API for backups, a new backup
configuration is created and associated with your database. This means
that you can no longer rely on your previously configured unmanaged
backups to work.

This parameter is used in multiple APIs. Refer to the API description
for details on how the operation uses it.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   AVAILABLE, FAILED, PROVISIONING, TERMINATED, TERMINATING, UPDATING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource to
see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by "--wait-for-
state". Defaults to 30 seconds.
