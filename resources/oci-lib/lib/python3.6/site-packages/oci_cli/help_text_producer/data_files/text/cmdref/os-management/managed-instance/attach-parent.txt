"attach-parent"
***************


Description
===========

Adds a parent software source to a managed instance. After the
software source has been added, then packages from that software
source can be installed on the managed instance. Software sources that
have this software source as a parent will be able to be added to this
managed instance.


Usage
=====

   oci os-management managed-instance attach-parent [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--managed-instance-id [text]

OCID for the managed instance

--software-source-id [text]

OCID for the Software Source


Optional Parameters
===================

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
