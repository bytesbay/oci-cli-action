"update"
********


Description
===========

Updates the protection settings in the Web Application Firewall
configuration for a WAAS policy. Protection settings allow you define
what action is taken when a request is blocked by the Web Application
Firewall, such as returning a response code or block page. Only the
fields specified in the request body will be updated; all other fields
will remain unchanged.


Usage

--force

Perform update without prompting for confirmation.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--if-match [text]

For optimistic concurrency control. In the *PUT* or *DELETE* call for
a resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from
a previous *GET* or *POST* response for that resource. The resource
will be updated or deleted only if the etag provided matches the
resource's current etag value.

--is-response-inspected [boolean]

Inspects the response body of origin responses. Can be used to detect
leakage of sensitive data. If unspecified, defaults to *false*.

**Note:** Only origin responses with a Content-Type matching a value
in *mediaTypes* will be inspected.

--max-argument-count [integer]

The maximum number of arguments allowed to be passed to your
application before an action is taken. Arguements are query parameters
or body parameters in a PUT or POST request. If unspecified, defaults
to *255*. This setting only applies if a corresponding protection rule
is enabled, such as the "Number of Arguments Limits" rule (key:
960335).

Example:

   If `maxArgumentCount` to `2` for the Max Number of Arguments protection rule (key: 960335), the following requests would be blocked: `GET /myapp/path?query=one&query=two&query=three` `POST /myapp/path` with Body `{"argument1":"one","argument2":"two","argument3":"three"}

--max-name-length-per-argument [integer]

The maximum length allowed for each argument name, in characters.
Arguements are query parameters or body parameters in a PUT or POST
request. If unspecified, defaults to *400*. This setting only applies
if a corresponding protection rule is enabled, such as the "Values
Limits" rule (key: 960208).

--max-response-size-in-ki-b [integer]

The maximum response size to be fully inspected, in binary kilobytes
(KiB). Anything over this limit will be partially inspected. If
unspecified, defaults to *1024*.

--max-total-name-length-of-arguments [integer]

The maximum length allowed for the sum of the argument name and value,
in characters. Arguements are query parameters or body parameters in a
PUT or POST request. If unspecified, defaults to *64000*. This setting
only applies if a corresponding protection rule is enabled, such as
the "Total Arguments Limits" rule (key: 960341).

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--media-types [complex type]

The list of media types to allow for inspection, if
*isResponseInspected* is enabled. Only responses with MIME types in
this list will be inspected. If unspecified, defaults to
*["text/html", "text/plain", "text/xml"]*.

   Supported MIME types include:

   * text/html     - text/plain     - text/asp     - text/css     -
     text/x-script     - application/json     - text/webviewhtml     -
     text/x-java-source     - application/x-javascript     -
     application/javascript     - application/ecmascript     -
     text/javascript     - text/ecmascript     - text/x-script.perl -
     text/x-script.phyton     - application/plain     -
     application/xml     - text/xml

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--recommendations-period-in-days [integer]

The length of time to analyze traffic traffic, in days. After the
analysis period, *WafRecommendations* will be populated. If
unspecified, defaults to *10*.

Use *GET /waasPolicies/{waasPolicyId}/wafRecommendations* to view WAF
recommendations.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource
and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation.
Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work
request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified,
returning on the first state. For example, "--wait-for-state"
SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on whichever
lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code
of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACCEPTED, CANCELED, CANCELING, FAILED, IN_PROGRESS, SUCCEEDED

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the work request
to see if it has reached the state defined by "--wait-for-state".
Defaults to 30 seconds.
