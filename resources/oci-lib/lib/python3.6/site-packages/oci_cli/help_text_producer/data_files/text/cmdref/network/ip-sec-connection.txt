ip-sec-connection
*****************


Description
===========

A connection between a DRG and CPE. This connection consists of
multiple IPSec tunnels. Creating this connection is one of the steps
required when setting up an IPSec VPN.

**Important:**  Each tunnel in an IPSec connection can use either
static routing or BGP dynamic routing (see the IPSecConnectionTunnel
object's *routing* attribute). Originally only static routing was
supported and every IPSec connection was required to have at least one
static route configured. To maintain backward compatibility in the API
when support for BPG dynamic routing was introduced, the API accepts
an empty list of static routes if you configure both of the IPSec
tunnels to use BGP dynamic routing. If you switch a tunnel's routing
from *BGP* to *STATIC*, you must first ensure that the IPSec
connection is configured with at least one valid CIDR block static
route. Oracle uses the IPSec connection's static routes when routing a
tunnel's traffic *only* if that tunnel's *routing* attribute =
*STATIC*. Otherwise the static routes are ignored.

For more information about the workflow for setting up an IPSec
connection, see IPSec VPN.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
