"get"
*****


Description
===========

Gets all records in the specified zone. The results are sorted by
*domain* in alphabetical order by default. For more information about
records, see Resource Record (RR) TYPEs.


Usage
=====

   oci dns record zone get [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--zone-name-or-id [text]

The name or OCID of the target zone.


Optional Parameters
===================

--all

Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you
cannot provide the "--limit" option.

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the compartment the resource belongs to.

--domain [text]

Search by domain. Will match any record whose domain (case-
insensitive) equals the provided value.

--domain-contains [text]

Search by domain. Will match any record whose domain (case-
insensitive) contains the provided value.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

an entity-tag that does not match any of those listed in the field-
value.
