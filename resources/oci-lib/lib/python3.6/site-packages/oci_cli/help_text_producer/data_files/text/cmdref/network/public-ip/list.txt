"list"
******


Description
===========

Lists the PublicIp objects in the specified compartment. You can
filter the list by using query parameters.

To list your reserved public IPs:   * Set *scope* = *REGION*
(required)   * Leave the *availabilityDomain* parameter empty   * Set
*lifetime* = *RESERVED*

To list the ephemeral public IPs assigned to a regional entity such as
a NAT gateway:   * Set *scope* = *REGION*  (required)   * Leave the
*availabilityDomain* parameter empty   * Set *lifetime* = *EPHEMERAL*

To list the ephemeral public IPs assigned to private IPs:   * Set
*scope* = *AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN* (required)   * Set the
*availabilityDomain* parameter to the desired availability domain
(required)   * Set *lifetime* = *EPHEMERAL*

**Note:** An ephemeral public IP assigned to a private IP is always in
the same availability domain and compartment as the private IP.


Usage
=====

   oci network public-ip list [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the compartment.

--scope [text]

Whether the public IP is regional or specific to a particular
availability domain.

* *REGION*: The public IP exists within a region and is assigned to
  a regional entity (such as a NatGateway), or can be assigned to a
  private IP in any availability domain in the region. Reserved public
  IPs have *scope* = *REGION*, as do ephemeral public IPs assigned to
  a regional entity.

* *AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN*: The public IP exists within the
  availability domain of the entity it's assigned to, which is
  specified by the *availabilityDomain* property of the public IP
  object. Ephemeral public IPs that are assigned to private IPs have
  *scope* = *AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN*.

Accepted values are:

   AVAILABILITY_DOMAIN, REGION


Optional Parameters
===================

--all

Fetches all pages of results. If you provide this option, then you
cannot provide the "--limit" option.

--availability-domain [text]

The name of the availability domain.

Example:

   Uocm:PHX-AD-1

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--lifetime [text]

A filter to return only public IPs that match given lifetime.

Accepted values are:

   EPHEMERAL, RESERVED

--limit [integer]

For list pagination. The maximum number of results per page, or items
to return in a paginated "List" call. For important details about how
pagination works, see List Pagination.

Example:

   50

--page [text]

For list pagination. The value of the *opc-next-page* response header
from the previous "List" call. For important details about how
pagination works, see List Pagination.

--page-size [integer]

When fetching results, the number of results to fetch per call. Only
valid when used with "--all" or "--limit", and ignored otherwise.
