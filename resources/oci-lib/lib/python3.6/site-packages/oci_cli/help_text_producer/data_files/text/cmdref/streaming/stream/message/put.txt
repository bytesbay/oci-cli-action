"put"
*****


Description
===========

Emits messages to a stream. There's no limit to the number of messages
in a request, but the total size of a message or request must be 1 MiB
or less. The service calculates the partition ID from the message key
and stores messages that share a key on the same partition. If a
message does not contain a key or if the key is null, the service
generates a message key for you. The partition ID cannot be passed as
a parameter.

The top level --endpoint parameter must be supplied for this
operation.


Usage
=====

   oci streaming stream message put [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--messages [complex type]

The array of messages to put into a stream. This is a complex type
whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string
on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--stream-id [text]

The OCID of the stream.


Optional Parameters
===================

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
