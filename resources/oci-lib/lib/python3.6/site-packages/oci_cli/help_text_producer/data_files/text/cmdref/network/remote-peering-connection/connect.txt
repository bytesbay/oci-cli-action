"connect"
*********


Description
===========

Connects this RPC to another one in a different region.

This operation must be called by the VCN administrator who is
designated as the *requestor* in the peering relationship. The
*acceptor* must implement an Identity and Access Management (IAM)
policy that gives the requestor permission to connect to RPCs in the
acceptor's compartment. Without that permission, this operation will
fail. For more information, see VCN Peering.


Usage
=====

   oci network remote-peering-connection connect [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--peer-id [text]

The OCID of the RPC you want to peer with.

--peer-region-name [text]

The name of the region that contains the RPC you want to peer with.

The region names that could be used are listed here:
https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm

Example:

   us-ashburn-1

--remote-peering-connection-id [text]

The OCID of the remote peering connection (RPC).


Optional Parameters
===================

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
