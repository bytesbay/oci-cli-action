*********************


Description
===========

A local peering gateway (LPG) is an object on a VCN that lets that VCN
peer with another VCN in the same region. *Peering* means that the two
VCNs can communicate using private IP addresses, but without the
traffic traversing the internet or routing through your on-premises
network. For more information, see VCN Peering.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
