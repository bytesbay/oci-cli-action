"make-bucket-writable"
**********************


Description
===========

Stops replication to the destination bucket and removes the
replication policy. When the replication policy was created, this
destination bucket became read-only except for new and changed objects
replicated automatically from the source bucket. MakeBucketWritable
removes the replication policy. This bucket is no longer the target
for replication and is now writable, allowing users to make changes to
bucket contents. If you are replicating to a destination bucket in a
different region, you must specify the --region parameter.


Usage
=====

   oci os replication make-bucket-writable [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--bucket-name, --bucket, -bn [text]

The name of the bucket. Avoid entering confidential information.
Example: *my-new-bucket1*


Optional Parameters
===================

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--namespace-name, --namespace, -ns [text]

get'
