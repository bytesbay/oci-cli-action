.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new DB system in the specified compartment and availability domain. The Oracle Database edition that you specify applies to all the databases on that DB system. The selected edition cannot be changed.
.sp
An initial database is created on the DB system based on the request parameters you provide and some default options. For detailed information about default options, see the following:

.TP
.B \-\-fault\-domains [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A Fault Domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an availability domain. Fault Domains let you distribute your instances so that they are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability domain. A hardware failure or maintenance that affects one Fault Domain does not affect DB systems in other Fault Domains.
.sp
If you do not specify the Fault Domain, the system selects one for you. To change the Fault Domain for a DB system, terminate it and launch a new DB system in the preferred Fault Domain.
.sp
If the node count is greater than 1, you can specify which Fault Domains these nodes will be distributed into. The system assigns your nodes automatically to the Fault Domains you specify so that no Fault Domain contains more than one node.
.sp
To get a list of Fault Domains, use the \fI\%ListFaultDomains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/FaultDomain/ListFaultDomains\fP> operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.

.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
