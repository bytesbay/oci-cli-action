.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCID of the compartment containing the steering policy.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-display\-name [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A user\-friendly name for the steering policy. Does not have to be unique and can be changed. Avoid entering confidential information.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-template [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A set of predefined rules based on the desired purpose of the steering policy. Each template utilizes Traffic Management\(aqs rules in a different order to produce the desired results when answering DNS queries.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBExample:\fP The \fIFAILOVER\fP template determines answers by filtering the policy\(aqs answers using the \fIFILTER\fP rule first, then the following rules in succession: \fIHEALTH\fP, \fIPRIORITY\fP, and \fILIMIT\fP\&. This gives the domain dynamic failover capability.
.sp
It is \fBstrongly recommended\fP to use a template other than \fICUSTOM\fP when creating a steering policy.
.sp
All templates require the rule order to begin with an unconditional \fIFILTER\fP rule that keeps answers contingent upon \fIanswer.isDisabled != true\fP, except for \fICUSTOM\fP\&. A defined \fIHEALTH\fP rule must follow the \fIFILTER\fP rule if the policy references a \fIhealthCheckMonitorId\fP\&. The last rule of a template must must be a \fILIMIT\fP rule. For more information about templates and code examples, see \fI\%Traffic Management API Guide\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/TrafficManagement/Concepts/trafficmanagementapi.htm\fP>\&.

.B \-\-template [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A set of predefined rules based on the desired purpose of the steering policy. Each template utilizes Traffic Management\(aqs rules in a different order to produce the desired results when answering DNS queries.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBExample:\fP The \fIFAILOVER\fP template determines answers by filtering the policy\(aqs answers using the \fIFILTER\fP rule first, then the following rules in succession: \fIHEALTH\fP, \fIPRIORITY\fP, and \fILIMIT\fP\&. This gives the domain dynamic failover capability.
.sp
It is \fBstrongly recommended\fP to use a template other than \fICUSTOM\fP when creating a steering policy.
.sp
All templates require the rule order to begin with an unconditional \fIFILTER\fP rule that keeps answers contingent upon \fIanswer.isDisabled != true\fP, except for \fICUSTOM\fP\&. A defined \fIHEALTH\fP rule must follow the \fIFILTER\fP rule if the policy references a \fIhealthCheckMonitorId\fP\&. The last rule of a template must must be a \fILIMIT\fP rule.
