.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-answers [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The set of all answers that can potentially issue from the steering policy.
.sp
This option is a JSON list with items of type SteeringPolicyAnswer.  For documentation on SteeringPolicyAnswer please see our API reference: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/dns/20180115/datatypes/SteeringPolicyAnswer\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.

.sp
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example

.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-health\-check\-monitor\-id [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCID of the health check monitor providing health data about the answers of the steering policy. A steering policy answer with \fIrdata\fP matching a monitored endpoint will use the health data of that endpoint. A steering policy answer with \fIrdata\fP not matching any monitored endpoint will be assumed healthy.
.sp
\fBNote:\fP To use the Health Check monitoring feature in a steering policy, a monitor must be created using the Health Checks service first. For more information on how to create a monitor, please see \fI\%Managing Health Checks\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/HealthChecks/Tasks/managinghealthchecks.htm\fP>\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-if\-match [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fIIf\-Match\fP header field makes the request method conditional on the existence of at least one current representation of the target resource, when the field\-value is \fI*\fP, or having a current representation of the target resource that has an entity\-tag matching a member of the list of entity\-tags provided in the field\-value.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-if\-unmodified\-since [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fIIf\-Unmodified\-Since\fP header field makes the request method conditional on the selected representation\(aqs last modification date being earlier than or equal to the date provided in the field\-value.  This field accomplishes the same purpose as If\-Match for cases where the user agent does not have an entity\-tag for the representation.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP\&. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-rules [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The series of rules that will be processed in sequence to reduce the pool of answers to a response for any given request.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The first rule receives a shuffled list of all answers, and every other rule receives the list of answers emitted by the one preceding it. The last rule populates the response.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This option is a JSON list with items of type SteeringPolicyRule.  For documentation on SteeringPolicyRule please see our API reference: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/dns/20180115/datatypes/SteeringPolicyRule\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-template [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
A set of predefined rules based on the desired purpose of the steering policy. Each template utilizes Traffic Management\(aqs rules in a different order to produce the desired results when answering DNS queries.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fBExample:\fP The \fIFAILOVER\fP template determines answers by filtering the policy\(aqs answers using the \fIFILTER\fP rule first, then the following rules in succession: \fIHEALTH\fP, \fIPRIORITY\fP, and \fILIMIT\fP\&. This gives the domain dynamic failover capability.
.sp
It is \fBstrongly recommended\fP to use a template other than \fICUSTOM\fP when creating a steering policy.
.sp
All templates require the rule order to begin with an unconditional \fIFILTER\fP rule that keeps answers contingent upon \fIanswer.isDisabled != true\fP, except for \fICUSTOM\fP\&. A defined \fIHEALTH\fP rule must follow the \fIFILTER\fP rule if the policy references a \fIhealthCheckMonitorId\fP\&. The last rule of a template must must be a \fILIMIT\fP rule. For more information about templates and code examples, see \fI\%Traffic Management API Guide\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/TrafficManagement/Concepts/trafficmanagementapi.htm\fP>\&.

.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
