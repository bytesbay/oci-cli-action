"update"
********


Description
===========

Updates the Device Fingerprint Challenge (DFC) settings in the Web
Application Firewall configuration for a policy. The DFC generates a
hashed signature of both virtual and real browsers based on 50+
attributes. These proprietary signatures are then leveraged for real-
time correlation to identify and block malicious bots.

The signature is based on a library of attributes detected via
JavaScript listeners; the attributes include OS, screen resolution,
fonts, UserAgent, IP address, etc. We are constantly making
improvements and considering new libraries to include in our DFC
build. We can also exclude attributes from the signature as needed.

DFC collects attributes to generate a hashed signature about a client
- if a fingerprint is not possible, then it will result in a block or
alert action. Actions can be enforced across multiple devices if they
share they have the same fingerprint.


Usage
=====

   oci waas device-fingerprint-challenge update [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--is-enabled [boolean]

Enables or disables the device fingerprint challenge Web Application
Firewall feature.

--waas-policy-id [text]

The OCID of the WAAS policy.


Optional Parameters
===================

--action [text]

The action to take on requests from detected bots. If unspecified,
defaults to *DETECT*.

Accepted values are:

   BLOCK, DETECT

--action-expiration-in-seconds [integer]

The number of seconds between challenges for the same IP address. If
unspecified, defaults to *60*.

--challenge-settings [complex type]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--failure-threshold [integer]

The number of failed requests allowed before taking action. If
unspecified, defaults to *10*.

--failure-threshold-expiration-in-seconds [integer]

The number of seconds before the failure threshold resets. If
unspecified, defaults to *60*.

--force

Perform update without prompting for confirmation.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--if-match [text]

For optimistic concurrency control. In the *PUT* or *DELETE* call for
a resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from
a previous *GET* or *POST* response for that resource. The resource
will be updated or deleted only if the etag provided matches the
resource's current etag value.

--max-address-count [integer]

The maximum number of IP addresses permitted with the same device
fingerprint. If unspecified, defaults to *20*.

--max-address-count-expiration-in-seconds [integer]

The number of seconds before the maximum addresses count resets. If
unspecified, defaults to *60*.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource
and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation.
Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work
request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified,
returning on the first state. For example, "--wait-for-state"
SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on whichever
lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code
of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACCEPTED, CANCELED, CANCELING, FAILED, IN_PROGRESS, SUCCEEDED

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the work request
to see if it has reached the state defined by "--wait-for-state".
Defaults to 30 seconds.
