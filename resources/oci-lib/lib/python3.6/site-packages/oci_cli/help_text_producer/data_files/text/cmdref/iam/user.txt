user
****


Description
===========

An individual employee or system that needs to manage or use your
company's Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources. Users might need to
launch instances, manage remote disks, work with your cloud network,
etc. Users have one or more IAM Service credentials (ApiKey,
UIPassword, SwiftPassword and AuthToken). For more information, see
User Credentials). End users of your application are not typically IAM
Service users. For conceptual information about users and other IAM
Service components, see Overview of the IAM Service.

These users are created directly within the Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure system, via the IAM service. They are different from
*federated users*, who authenticate themselves to the Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure Console via an identity provider. For more information,
see Identity Providers and Federation.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
