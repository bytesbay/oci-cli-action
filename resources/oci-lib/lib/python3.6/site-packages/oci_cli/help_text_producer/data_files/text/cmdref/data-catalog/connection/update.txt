"update"
********


Description
===========

Updates a specific connection of a data asset.


Usage
=====

   oci data-catalog connection update [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--catalog-id [text]

Unique catalog identifier.

--connection-key [text]

Unique connection key.

--data-asset-key [text]

Unique data asset key.


Optional Parameters
===================

--description [text]

A description of the connection.

--display-name [text]

A user-friendly display name. Does not have to be unique, and it's
changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.

--enc-properties [complex type]

A map of maps that contains the encrypted values for sensitive
properties which are specific to the connection type. Each connection
type definition defines it's set of required and optional properties.
The map keys are category names and the values are maps of property
name to property value. Every property is contained inside of a
category. Most connections have required properties within the
"default" category. To determine the set of optional and required
properties for a connection type, a query can be done on
'/types?type=connection' that returns a collection of all connection
types. The appropriate connection type, which will include definitions
of all of it's properties, can be identified from this collection.
Example: *{"encProperties": { "default": { "password": "pwd"}}}* This
is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be
provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--force

Perform update without prompting for confirmation.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--if-match [text]

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource. The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource's
current etag value.

--is-default [boolean]

Indicates whether this connection is the default connection.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--properties [complex type]

A map of maps that contains the properties which are specific to the
connection type. Each connection type definition defines it's set of
required and optional properties. The map keys are category names and
the values are maps of property name to property value. Every property
is contained inside of a category. Most connections have required
properties within the "default" category. To determine the set of
optional and required properties for a connection type, a query can be
done on '/types?type=connection' that returns a collection of all
connection types. The appropriate connection type, which will include
definitions of all of it's properties, can be identified from this
collection. Example: *{"properties": { "default": { "username":
"user1"}}}* This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The
value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as
a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACTIVE, CREATING, DELETED, DELETING, FAILED, INACTIVE, MOVING, UPDATING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource to
see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by "--wait-for-
state". Defaults to 30 seconds.
