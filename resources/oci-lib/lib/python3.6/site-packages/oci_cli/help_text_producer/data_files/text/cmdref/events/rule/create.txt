"create"
********


Description
===========

Creates a new rule.


Usage
=====

   oci events rule create [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--actions [complex type]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the compartment to which this rule belongs.

--condition [text]

A filter that specifies the event that will trigger actions associated
with this rule. A few important things to remember about filters:

* Fields not mentioned in the condition are ignored. You can create
  a valid filter that matches all events with two curly brackets: *{}*

  For more examples, see Matching Events with Filters. * For a
  condition with fields to match an event, the event must contain all
  the field names listed in the condition. Field names must appear in
  the condition with the same nesting structure used in the event.

  For a list of reference events, see Services that Produce Events. *
  Rules apply to events in the compartment in which you create them
  and any child compartments. This means that a condition specified by
  a rule only matches events emitted from resources in the compartment
  or any of its child compartments. * Wildcard matching is supported
  with the asterisk (*) character.

  For examples of wildcard matching, see Matching Events with Filters

Example:

   \"eventType\": \"com.oraclecloud.databaseservice.autonomous.database.backup.end\"

--display-name [text]

A string that describes the rule. It does not have to be unique, and
you can change it. Avoid entering confidential information.

--is-enabled [boolean]

Whether or not this rule is currently enabled.

Example:

   true


Optional Parameters
===================

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--description [text]

A string that describes the details of the rule. It does not have to
be unique, and you can change it. Avoid entering confidential
information.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. Exists for cross-
compatibility only. For more information, see Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Department": "Finance"}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACTIVE, CREATING, DELETED, DELETING, FAILED, INACTIVE, UPDATING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource to
see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by "--wait-for-
state". Defaults to 30 seconds.
