tag-default
***********


Description
===========

Tag defaults let you specify a default tag (tagnamespace.tag="value")
to apply to all resource types in a specified compartment. The tag
default is applied at the time the resource is created. Resources that
exist in the compartment before you create the tag default are not
tagged. The *TagDefault* object specifies the tag and compartment
details.

Tag defaults are inherited by child compartments. This means that if
you set a tag default on the root compartment for a tenancy, all
resources that are created in the tenancy are tagged. For more
information about using tag defaults, see Managing Tag Defaults.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator.
