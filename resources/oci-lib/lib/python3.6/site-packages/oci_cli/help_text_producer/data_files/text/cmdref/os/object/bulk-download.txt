"bulk-download"
***************


Description
===========

Downloads all objects which match the given prefix to a given
directory.


Usage
=====

   oci os object bulk-download [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

-bn, --bucket-name [text]

The name of the bucket.

--download-dir [text]

The directory where retrieved objects will be placed as files. This
directory will be created if it does not exist.


Optional Parameters
===================

--delimiter [text]

When this parameter is set, only objects whose names do not contain
the delimiter character (after an optionally specified prefix) are
returned. Scanned objects whose names contain the delimiter have part
of their name up to the last occurrence of the delimiter (after the
optional prefix) returned as a set of prefixes. Note: Only '/' is a
supported delimiter character at this time.

--encryption-key-file [filename]

A file containing the base64-encoded string of the AES-256 encryption
key associated with the object.

--exclude [text]

Only download objects which do not match the provided pattern.
Patterns are taken relative to the DOWNLOAD directory. This option can
be provided mulitple times to match on mulitple patterns. Supported
pattern symbols are: 

*: Matches everything

?: Matches any single character

[sequence]: Matches any character in sequence

[!sequence]: Matches any character not in sequence

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--include [text]

Only download objects which match the provided pattern. Patterns are
taken relative to the DOWNLOAD directory. This option can be provided
mulitple times to match on mulitple patterns. Supported pattern
symbols are: 

*: Matches everything

?: Matches any single character

[sequence]: Matches any character in sequence

[!sequence]: Matches any character not in sequence

--multipart-download-threshold [integer range]

Objects larger than this size (in MiB) will be downloaded in multiple
parts. The minimum allowable threshold is 128 MiB.

-ns, --namespace, --namespace-name [text]

The top-level namespace used for the request. If not provided, this
parameter will be obtained internally using a call to 'oci os ns get'

--no-overwrite

If a file with the same name as an object already exists in the
download directory, do not overwite it. If neither this flag nor
--overwrite is specified, you will be prompted each time a file would
be overwritten

--overwrite

If a file with the same name as an object already exists in the
download directory, overwrite it. If neither this flag nor --no-
overwrite is specified, you will be prompted each time a file would be
overwritten.

--parallel-operations-count [integer]

The number of parallel operations to perform. Decreasing this value
will make bulk downloads less resource intensive but they may take
longer. Increasing this value may improve bulk download times, but the
upload process will consume more system resources and network
bandwidth. [default: 10]

--part-size [integer range]

Part size (in MiB) to use when downloading an object in multiple
parts. The minimum allowable size is 128 MiB.

--prefix [text]

Retrieve all objects with the given prefix. Omit this parameter to get
all objects in the bucket

   Examples

======================================================================


Download all objects in the bucket
----------------------------------

    oci os object bulk-download -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --download-dir path/to/download/directory


Download all objects that match a given prefix
----------------------------------------------

    oci os object bulk-download -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --download-dir path/to/download/directory --prefix myprefix

You can download all objects that match a given prefix by specifying
the --prefix flag. In the above example, "--prefix myprefix" would
match object names such as myPrefix_textfile1.txt,
myPrefix_myImage.png etc.

If you have named your objects so that they exist in Object Storage as
a hierarchy, e.g. level1/level2/level3/myobject.txt, then you can
download objects at a given level (and all sub levels) by specifying a
prefix:

    oci os object bulk-download -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --download-dir path/to/download/directory --prefix level1/level2/

This will download all objects of the form level1/level2/<object
name>, level1/level2/leve3/<object name>,
level1/level2/leve3/level4/<object name> etc.


Limiting downloaded objects using a prefix and delimiter
--------------------------------------------------------

    oci os object bulk-download -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --download-dir path/to/download/directory --prefix level1/level2/ --delimiter /

If you have named your objects so that they exist in Object Storage as
a hierarchy, e.g. level1/level2/level3/myobject.txt, and you only want
to download objects at a given level of the hierarchy, e.g. example
everything of the form level1/level2/<object name> but not
level1/level2/leve3/<object name> or any other sub-levels, you can
specify a prefix and delimiter. Currently the only supported delimiter
is /


Overwriting or skipping files
-----------------------------

    oci os object bulk-download -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --download-dir path/to/download/directory --overwrite
    oci os object bulk-download -ns mynamespace -bn mybucket --download-dir path/to/download/directory --no-overwrite

If files with the same name as the objects being downloaded already
exist in the download directory, you can opt to overwrite them with
the --overwrite option, or preserve them with the --no-overwrite
option.
