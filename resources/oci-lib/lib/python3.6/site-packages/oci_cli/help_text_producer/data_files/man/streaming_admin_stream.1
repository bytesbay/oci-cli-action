.B \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the compartment into which the resource should be moved.
.INDENT 0.0

.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP

.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the if\-match parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource. The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.

.SS \fBcreate\fP
.SS Description
.sp
Starts the provisioning of a new stream. The stream will be created in the given compartment id or stream pool id, depending on which parameter is specified. Compartment id and stream pool id cannot be specified at the same time. To track the progress of the provisioning, you can periodically call \fI\%GetStream\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/streaming/20180418/Stream/GetStream\fP>\&. In the response, the \fIlifecycleState\fP parameter of the \fI\%Stream\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/streaming/20180418/Stream/\fP> object tells you its current state.

.SS \fBdelete\fP
.SS Description
.sp
Deletes a stream and its content. Stream contents are deleted immediately. The service retains records of the stream itself for 90 days after deletion. The \fIlifecycleState\fP parameter of the \fIStream\fP object changes to \fIDELETING\fP and the stream becomes inaccessible for read or write operations. To verify that a stream has been deleted, make a \fI\%GetStream\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/streaming/20180418/Stream/GetStream\fP> request. If the call returns the stream\(aqs lifecycle state as \fIDELETED\fP, then the stream has been deleted. If the call returns a "404 Not Found" error, that means all records of the stream have been deleted.

Free\-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key\-value pair that is applied with no predefined name, type, or namespace. Exists for cross\-compatibility only. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{"Department": "Finance"}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-if\-match [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a resource, set the if\-match parameter to the value of the etag from a previous GET or POST response for that resource. The resource will be updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource\(aqs current etag value.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP\&. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-stream\-pool\-id [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the stream pool where the stream should be moved.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.sp
Accepted values are:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.B \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Check every \fB\-\-wait\-interval\-seconds\fP to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP\&. Defaults to 30 seconds.
