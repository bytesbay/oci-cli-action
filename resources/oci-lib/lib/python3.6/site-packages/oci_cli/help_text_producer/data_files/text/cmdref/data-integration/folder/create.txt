   oci data-integration folder create [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--identifier [text]

Value can only contain upper case letters, underscore and numbers. It
should begin with upper case letter or underscore. The value can be
edited by the user.

--name [text]

Free form text without any restriction on permitted characters. Name
can have letters, numbers, and special characters. The value can be
edited by the user and it is restricted to 1000 characters

--registry-metadata [complex type]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--workspace-id [text]

DIS workspace id


Optional Parameters
===================

--category-name [text]

categoryName

--description [text]

Detailed description for the object.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions
