.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The properties that define a load balancer. For more information, see \fI\%Managing a Load Balancer\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Balance/Tasks/managingloadbalancer.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you\(aqre not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you\(aqre an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see \fI\%Getting Started with Policies\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For information about endpoints and signing API requests, see \fI\%About the API\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/API/Concepts/usingapi.htm\fP>\&. For information about available SDKs and tools, see \fI\%SDKS and Other Tools\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdks.htm\fP>\&.

.SS Description
.sp
Moves a load balancer into a different compartment within the same tenancy. For information about moving resources between compartments, see \fI\%Moving Resources to a Different Compartment\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingcompartments.htm#moveRes\fP>\&.

.SS Required Parameters
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-compartment\-id, \-c [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the compartment to move the load balancer to.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-load\-balancer\-id [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fI\%OCID\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP> of the load balancer to move.
.SS Optional Parameters
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-if\-match [text]
.UNINDENT

.TP
.B \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.

.SS \fBcreate\fP
.SS Description
.sp
Creates a new load balancer in the specified compartment. For general information about load balancers, see \fI\%Overview of the Load Balancing Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Balance/Concepts/balanceoverview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For the purposes of access control, you must provide the OCID of the compartment where you want the load balancer to reside. Notice that the load balancer doesn\(aqt have to be in the same compartment as the VCN or backend set. If you\(aqre not sure which compartment to use, put the load balancer in the same compartment as the VCN. For information about access control and compartments, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
You must specify a display name for the load balancer. It does not have to be unique, and you can change it.
.sp
For information about Availability Domains, see \fI\%Regions and Availability Domains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm\fP>\&. To get a list of Availability Domains, use the \fIListAvailabilityDomains\fP operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
.sp
All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including load balancers, get an Oracle\-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource\(aqs OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console. Fore more information, see \fI\%Resource Identifiers\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
After you send your request, the new object\(aqs state will temporarily be PROVISIONING. Before using the object, first make sure its state has changed to RUNNING.
.sp
When you create a load balancer, the system assigns an IP address. To get the IP address, use the \fI\%GetLoadBalancer\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/loadbalancer/20170115/LoadBalancer/GetLoadBalancer\fP> operation.

When creating a load balancer, there are two main options:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Providing all information when calling the \fBcreate\fP command
.IP \(bu 2
Providing minimal information to the \fBcreate\fP command then then using individual commands to "assemble" the load balancer post\-creation
.UNINDENT
.sp
Working samples for both approaches can be found \fI\%here\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/oracle/oci-cli/blob/master/scripts/create_load_balancer.sh\fP>\&.
.SS Providing all information at create time
.sp
Under this option, you would call the \fBcreate\fP command and specify the \fB\-\-certificates\fP, \fB\-\-backend\-sets\fP, \fB\-\-listener\fP and \fB\-\-path\-route\-sets\fP options in order to also create these items when creating the load balancer. Since those options are complex types, it is recommended that you place their input in JSON files and then specify these files as input to the command using the \fI\%file://\fP syntax. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-backend\-sets file://path/to/backend/set/file.json
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can discover the format of the input you need to provide by using the \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input certificates
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input backend\-sets
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input listeners
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input path\-route\-sets
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As an alternative to providing those individal options, you can specify all the input to the command in a single file using the \fB\-\-from\-json\fP option. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-from\-json file://path/to/file/of/input.json
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can discover the format of the input you need to provide by using the \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
oci lb load\-balancer create \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Providing minimal information and then assembling via other commands
.sp
Under this option, you would only supply the mandatory arguments to the \fBcreate\fP command (and not any of the input marked as \fBCOMPLEX TYPE\fP) and then use other operations to add certificates, backend sets, listeners and path route sets. This approach is more applicable if you do not wish to prepare JSON input files.
.sp
The key commands you\(aqll need to be aware of are:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
This command
.IP \(bu 2
Create certificate
.IP \(bu 2
Create backend set
.IP \(bu 2
Create backend
.IP \(bu 2
List protocols
.IP \(bu 2
Create listener
.IP \(bu 2
Create path route set
.UNINDENT
.sp
You would tie these together in sequence by:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
