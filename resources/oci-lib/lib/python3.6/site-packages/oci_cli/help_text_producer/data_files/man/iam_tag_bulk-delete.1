.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Deletes the specified tag key definitions. This operation triggers a process that removes the tags from all resources in your tenancy.
.sp
The following actions happen immediately: \    * If the tag is a cost\-tracking tag, the tag no longer counts against your   10 cost\-tracking tags limit, even if you do not disable the tag before running this operation.   * If the tag is used with dynamic groups, the rules that contain the tag are no longer   evaluated against the tag.
.sp
After you start this operation, the state of the tag changes to DELETING, and tag removal from resources begins. This process can take up to 48 hours depending on the number of resources that are tagged and the regions in which those resources reside.
.sp
When all tags have been removed, the state changes to DELETED. You cannot restore a deleted tag. After the tag state changes to DELETED, you can use the same tag name again.
.sp
After you start this operation, you cannot start either the \fI\%DeleteTag\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/latest/Tag/DeleteTag\fP> or the \fI\%CascadeDeleteTagNamespace\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/TagNamespace/CascadeDeleteTagNamespace\fP> operation until this process completes.
.sp
In order to delete tags, you must first retire the tags. Use \fI\%UpdateTag\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/identity/20160918/Tag/UpdateTag\fP> to retire a tag.

.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-tag\-definition\-ids [complex type]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The OCIDs of the tag definitions to delete
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-param\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SH OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-from\-json [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.UNINDENT
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the work request to reach the state defined by \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP\&. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-wait\-for\-state [text]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the work request reaches a certain state. Multiple states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP SUCCEEDED \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP FAILED would return on whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.

Accepted values are:

.sp
Check every \fB\-\-wait\-interval\-seconds\fP to see whether the work request to see if it has reached the state defined by \fB\-\-wait\-for\-state\fP\&. Defaults to 30 seconds.
