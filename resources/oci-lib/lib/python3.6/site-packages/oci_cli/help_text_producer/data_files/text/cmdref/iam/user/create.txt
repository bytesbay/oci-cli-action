"create"
********


Description
===========

Creates a new user in your tenancy. For conceptual information about
users, your tenancy, and other IAM Service components, see Overview of
the IAM Service.

You must specify your tenancy's OCID as the compartment ID in the
request object (remember that the tenancy is simply the root
compartment). Notice that IAM resources (users, groups, compartments,
and some policies) reside within the tenancy itself, unlike cloud
resources such as compute instances, which typically reside within
compartments inside the tenancy. For information about OCIDs, see
Resource Identifiers.

You must also specify a *name* for the user, which must be unique
across all users in your tenancy and cannot be changed. Allowed
characters: No spaces. Only letters, numerals, hyphens, periods,
underscores, +, and @. If you specify a name that's already in use,
you'll get a 409 error. This name will be the user's login to the
Console. You might want to pick a name that your company's own
identity system (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP, etc.) already uses. If
you delete a user and then create a new user with the same name,
they'll be considered different users because they have different
OCIDs.

You must also specify a *description* for the user (although it can be
an empty string). It does not have to be unique, and you can change it
anytime with UpdateUser. You can use the field to provide the user's
full name, a description, a nickname, or other information to
generally identify the user.

After you send your request, the new object's *lifecycleState* will
temporarily be CREATING. Before using the object, first make sure its
*lifecycleState* has changed to ACTIVE.

A new user has no permissions until you place the user in one or more
groups (see AddUserToGroup). If the user needs to access the Console,
you need to provide the user a password (see CreateOrResetUIPassword).
If the user needs to access the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure REST API,
you need to upload a public API signing key for that user (see
Required Keys and OCIDs and also UploadApiKey).

**Important:** Make sure to inform the new user which compartment(s)
they have access to.


Usage
=====

   oci iam user create [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--description [text]

The description you assign to the user during creation. Does not have
to be unique, and it's changeable.

--name [text]

The name you assign to the user during creation. This is the user's
login for the Console. The name must be unique across all users in the
tenancy and cannot be changed.


Optional Parameters
===================

--compartment-id, -c [text]

The OCID of the tenancy containing the user. If not provided, this
parameter will use the tenancy's OCID (root compartment's OCID) from
the config file.

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags. Example:
*{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}* This is a complex type whose
value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the
command line or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file
syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--email [text]

The email you assign to the user. Has to be unique across the tenancy.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags. Example: *{"Department": "Finance"}* This is a complex
type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a
string on the command line or passed in as a file using the
file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   ACTIVE, CREATING, DELETED, DELETING, INACTIVE

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource to
see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by "--wait-for-
state". Defaults to 30 seconds.
