.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.

This operation asynchronously creates, modifies or deletes a resource and uses a work request to track the progress of the operation.

.SS \fBupdate\fP
.SS Description
.sp
Update the configuration of a DB System.
.sp
Updating different fields in the DB System will have different results on the uptime of the DB System. For example, changing the displayName of a DB System will take effect immediately, but changing the shape of a DB System is an asynchronous operation that involves provisioning new Compute resources, pausing the DB System and migrating storage before making the DB System available again.
