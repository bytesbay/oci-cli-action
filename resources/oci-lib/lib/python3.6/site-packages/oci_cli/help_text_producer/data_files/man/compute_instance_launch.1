.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Creates a new instance in the specified compartment and the specified availability domain. For general information about instances, see \fI\%Overview of the Compute Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Compute/Concepts/computeoverview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For information about access control and compartments, see \fI\%Overview of the IAM Service\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
For information about availability domains, see \fI\%Regions and Availability Domains\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm\fP>\&. To get a list of availability domains, use the \fIListAvailabilityDomains\fP operation in the Identity and Access Management Service API.
.sp
All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including instances, get an Oracle\-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the response. You can also retrieve a resource\(aqs OCID by using a List API operation on that resource type, or by viewing the resource in the Console.
.sp
To launch an instance using an image or a boot volume use the \fIsourceDetails\fP parameter in \fI\%LaunchInstanceDetails\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/LaunchInstanceDetails\fP>\&.
.sp
When you launch an instance, it is automatically attached to a virtual network interface card (VNIC), called the \fIprimary VNIC\fP\&. The VNIC has a private IP address from the subnet\(aqs CIDR. You can either assign a private IP address of your choice or let Oracle automatically assign one. You can choose whether the instance has a public IP address. To retrieve the addresses, use the \fI\%ListVnicAttachments\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/VnicAttachment/ListVnicAttachments\fP> operation to get the VNIC ID for the instance, and then call \fI\%GetVnic\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Vnic/GetVnic\fP> with the VNIC ID.
.sp
You can later add secondary VNICs to an instance. For more information, see \fI\%Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm\fP>\&.
.sp
To launch an instance from a Marketplace image listing, you must provide the image ID of the listing resource version that you want, but you also must subscribe to the listing before you try to launch the instance. To subscribe to the listing, use the \fI\%GetAppCatalogListingAgreements\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersionAgreements/GetAppCatalogListingAgreements\fP> operation to get the signature for the terms of use agreement for the desired listing resource version. Then, call \fI\%CreateAppCatalogSubscription\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogSubscription/CreateAppCatalogSubscription\fP> with the signature. To get the image ID for the LaunchInstance operation, call \fI\%GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/AppCatalogListingResourceVersion/GetAppCatalogListingResourceVersion\fP>\&.

.sp
The \fB\-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input\fP option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.

.TP
.B \-\-ipxe\-script\-file [filename]
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is an advanced option.
.sp
When a bare metal or virtual machine instance boots, the iPXE firmware that runs on the instance is configured to run an iPXE script to continue the boot process.
.sp
If you want more control over the boot process, you can provide your own custom iPXE script that will run when the instance boots; however, you should be aware that the same iPXE script will run every time an instance boots; not only after the initial LaunchInstance call.
.sp
The default iPXE script connects to the instance\(aqs local boot volume over iSCSI and performs a network boot. If you use a custom iPXE script and want to network\-boot from the instance\(aqs local boot volume over iSCSI the same way as the default iPXE script, you should use the following iSCSI IP address: 169.254.0.2, and boot volume IQN: iqn.2015\-02.oracle.boot.
