"update"
********


Description
===========

Updates certain fields on the specified instance. Fields that are not
provided in the request will not be updated. Avoid entering
confidential information.

Changes to metadata fields will be reflected in the instance metadata
service (this may take up to a minute).

The OCID of the instance remains the same.


Usage
=====

   oci compute instance update [OPTIONS]


Required Parameters
===================

--instance-id [text]

The OCID of the instance.


Optional Parameters
===================

--agent-config [complex type]

Instance agent configuration options to choose for updating the
instance This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The
value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as
a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--availability-config [complex type]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--defined-tags [complex type]

Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a
namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--display-name [text]

A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable.
Avoid entering confidential information.

Example:

   My bare metal instance

--extended-metadata [complex type]

Additional metadata key/value pairs that you provide. They serve the
same purpose and functionality as fields in the *metadata* object.

They are distinguished from *metadata* fields in that these can be
nested JSON objects (whereas *metadata* fields are string/string maps
only).

The "user_data" field and the "ssh_authorized_keys" field cannot be
changed after an instance has launched. Any request that updates,
removes, or adds either of these fields will be rejected. You must
provide the same values for "user_data" and "ssh_authorized_keys" that
already exist on the instance.

The combined size of the *metadata* and *extendedMetadata* objects can
be a maximum of 32,000 bytes. This is a complex type whose value must
be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command
line or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--fault-domain [text]

A fault domain is a grouping of hardware and infrastructure within an
availability domain. Each availability domain contains three fault
domains. Fault domains let you distribute your instances so that they
are not on the same physical hardware within a single availability
domain. A hardware failure or Compute hardware maintenance that
affects one fault domain does not affect instances in other fault
domains.

To get a list of fault domains, use the ListFaultDomains operation in
the Identity and Access Management Service API.

Example:

   FAULT-DOMAIN-1

--force

Perform update without prompting for confirmation.

--freeform-tags [complex type]

Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair
with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see
Resource Tags.

Example:

   {"Department": "Finance"}

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--from-json [text]

Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the
file://path-to/file syntax.

The "--generate-full-command-json-input" option can be used to
generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The
key names are pre-populated and match the command option names
(converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment-id -->
compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by
the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For
any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key
can be a JSON array.

Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists
in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line
specified value will be used.

For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with
advanced JSON options" link: https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Conte
nt/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions

--if-match [text]

For optimistic concurrency control. In the PUT or DELETE call for a
resource, set the *if-match* parameter to the value of the etag from a
previous GET or POST response for that resource.  The resource will be
updated or deleted only if the etag you provide matches the resource's
current etag value.

--launch-options [complex type]

Options for tuning the compatibility and performance of VM shapes.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--max-wait-seconds [integer]

The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state
defined by "--wait-for-state". Defaults to 1200 seconds.

--metadata [complex type]

Custom metadata key/value string pairs that you provide. Any set of
key/value pairs provided here will completely replace the current set
of key/value pairs in the *metadata* field on the instance.

The "user_data" field and the "ssh_authorized_keys" field cannot be
changed after an instance has launched. Any request that updates,
removes, or adds either of these fields will be rejected. You must
provide the same values for "user_data" and "ssh_authorized_keys" that
already exist on the instance.

The combined size of the *metadata* and *extendedMetadata* objects can
be a maximum of 32,000 bytes. This is a complex type whose value must
be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command
line or passed in as a file using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--shape [text]

The shape of the instance. The shape determines the number of CPUs and
the amount of memory allocated to the instance. For more information
about how to change shapes, and a list of shapes that are supported,
see Editing an Instance.

For details about the CPUs, memory, and other properties of each
shape, see Compute Shapes.

The new shape must be compatible with the image that was used to
launch the instance. You can enumerate all available shapes and
determine image compatibility by calling ListShapes.

If the instance is running when you change the shape, the instance is
rebooted.

Example:

   VM.Standard2.1

--shape-config [complex type]

This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can
be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file
using the file://path/to/file syntax.

The "--generate-param-json-input" option can be used to generate an
example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this
example in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in
via the file:// syntax.

--wait-for-state [text]

This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a
defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and
then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. Multiple
states can be specified, returning on the first state. For example, "
--wait-for-state" SUCCEEDED "--wait-for-state" FAILED would return on
whichever lifecycle state is reached first. If timeout is reached, a
return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1
is returned.

Accepted values are:

   CREATING_IMAGE, MOVING, PROVISIONING, RUNNING, STARTING, STOPPED, STOPPING, TERMINATED, TERMINATING

--wait-interval-seconds [integer]

Check every "--wait-interval-seconds" to see whether the resource to
see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by "--wait-for-
state". Defaults to 30 seconds.
